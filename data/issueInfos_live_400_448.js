        "Description": "Suspicious skin lesions are most commonly mentioned in relation to a suspected skin cancer. Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A suspicious skin lesion is most commonly mentioned if it shows one or more of the symptoms below: Noticeable moles (that are asymmetric or have uneven borders, a variety of colors, changing rapidly, itching or bleeding), not healing wounds, especially in typical regions (parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as face, scalp, neck, décolleté, forearms and hands), noticeable scales, itching. Changes to the skin, especially suspicious ones should be examined by a doctor – ideally by a dermatologist.",
        "MedicalCondition": "A suspicious change of the skin might be caused by an infection in or on the skin such as a wart. The virus of a wart is transmitted through skin contact. Shingles or chickenpox that happens throughout the body can also trigger suspicious changes of skin. Birthmarks are changes of skin that are usually present since birth. Some suspicious changes can follow a sensitivity or an allergic response triggered by conditions such as diabetes or poor circulation. Autoimmune illnesses like psoriasis can also trigger changes on the skin. Most cancers are detected through obvious signs such as sickness, pain, tenderness, bumps or lumps. However, it is difficult to identify a change of skin since the change is not often obvious. The detection of a suspicious change of skin is tricky because usually this change happens gradually and without clear signs. However, it is recommended to use always a thumb to feel for any change while making the difference between normal and unusual detail. A person should pay attention to lesions, moles, and spots present on the body in order to compare it with details that seem different. Other suspicious signs include changes happening on a mole such as bleeding, oozing or the presence of a nodule or bump, pain, tenderness or itchiness. Further signs that should be considered as a warning are a new engorgement beyond the limit, redness or a tenderness that is hard to heal. A pigment that spreads from its boundary into the skin all around should be taken as a warning sign as well.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Suspicious skin lesions can occur at any age. If an affected person observes a lesion that matches the criteria mentioned above, or worries for other reasons, he should consult a doctor, ideally a dermatologist. If the doctor finds the skin lesion suspicious as well, it will usually be removed surgically. A pathologist will evaluate the removed tissue under a microscope. If the suspicion is confirmed, the doctor will discuss the next steps with the affected person. Depending on the pathologist’s findings, the previous surgery may have been sufficient, but sometimes a larger area around the lesion might be needed to be removed, or further therapy (chemo-, radiotherapy) may be necessary."

        "Description": "An infection of the urinary tract can become serious if the kidneys are infected. Irritants include catheter used for a long time, spermicidal jellies or spray for feminine hygiene. Urinary tract infection can result also from another disease. Antibiotics are used usually when the infectious agent is a bacteria. Other types of urinary tract infections are treated according to the underlying trigger. Sometimes, urinary tract infection can improve without treatment. In most cases, the recovery is fast and without complications. Women are at higher risk to develop the condition than men since their urethra is shorter than men’s and the opening is closer to the anus. The urethra is a small tube that transports urine from the bladder. It is possible however less common for an infection to be triggered by radiation therapy or certain medicines.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A urinary tract infection is an infection that affects the urinary bladder or the renal pelvis. The infection is usually caused by intestinal bacteria. Catheters pose a risk of infection as well. Common symptoms include desire to urinate, burning, and frequent urination.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Women are more likely to get a urinary tract infection than men, since the urethra (thus the distance that bacteria have to travel) is shorter in women. Common causes include sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and exposure to cool and wet conditions. Additionally, abnormal draining of the urinary tract may also play a role. The affected person may experience pain, burning, and itching during urination as well as an urge to urinate frequently. However, should the urinary tract infection spread to include the kidneys (known as pyelonephritis), it then becomes a serious illness. Accompanying the above symptoms are fever and side pains.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "An infection of the urinary tract (also called a UTI) is usually harmless and requires no treatment in women without symptoms. Women and men affected by symptoms usually require treatment with antibiotics. An infection of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) can spread to the bloodstream and thus requires treatment with antibiotics."

        "Description": "Osteoporosis is a common disease. Various causes lead to the dissolving of body salts from the bones, and the bone becomes porous. It is characterized by a reduction in bone density, which leads to an increased risk of breaking bones throughout the entire skeleton. The most common fractures are the vertebrae, femur (nearest the hips), forearm (near the wrist), head of the humerus, and the pelvis.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of bone substance of the whole body, thinning or shrinking the trabeculae. This leads to the bones becoming fragile, so that they break easier or spontaneously. Frequent fractures of e.g. vertebral bodies, thigh- or forearm bones can occur.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Osteoporosis mainly affects elderly persons and, within this group, mainly women. Most common reason is a vitamin D deficiency; in women it is mainly hormonal changes after the menopause that causes calcium and phosphate to dissolve from the bone. The bone mass decreases, the bones are not as robust anymore and typical fractures and related pain occur. Spontaneous fractures (without any hit- or push-impact) most commonly occur in the vertebrae, but also in the pelvis or the forearm. Low bone-stability leads to frequent typical fractures that can occur either spontaneously or following slight traumata.",

        "ProfName": "Osteoporosis",
        "Synonyms": null,
        "TreatmentDescription": "Blood tests and bone density measurements with certain x-rays can help the doctor to diagnose osteoporosis. Besides tending to existing fractures, treatment will depend on the identified causes. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D as well as regular exercise are very important in the prevention and reduction of bone loss. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, it’s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately. Additionally, a class of medications called bisphosphonates may be used to stop further bone loss. Often intake of vitamin D and calcium can be sufficient, but sometimes more comprehensive measures may be necessary."

        "Description": "Tick-borne encephalitis is an infectious viral infectious disease which impactes the central nervous system of a person. Over the past decades, TBE has become an increasing public health concern in Asia and Europe and it is the most important viral tick-borne disease which exists Eastern Europe, Central Europe as well as Russia.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infectious viral disease transmitted by ticks and in certain cases it can lead to inflammation of the brain or the meninges. There are three forms of the disease related to the virus subtypes: namely, Siberian, Far Eastern and European.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Ticks that carry the TBE virus are widespread throughout the TBE-belt (Eurasia). One to four weeks after being bitten by an infected tick, flu-like symptoms such as headaches, lethargy, fever, and joint pain occur. In most cases the illness disappears after that.  However, in 5-15% of those affected, after a symptom-free period, a new wave of illness develops into meningoencephalitis (inflammation and infection of the meninges and brain), which is experienced as headaches, sensitivity to light, dizziness, and impaired walking.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Paralysis of the limbs or facial nerves is rare in cases of TBE, but the disease is fatal in 1% of those who contract it. There is no treatment for TBE, but the symptoms can be alleviated. There is a vaccine for the TBE virus and people who live in or often visit high-risk areas for TBE are advised to get the vaccine. Tips for dealing with tick bites: 1) One can prevent tick bites by wearing long sleeves and pants, staying out of the under bush and areas with tall grass, and checking oneself for ticks after the excursion. 2) If the person is bitten by a tick, he should remove it from his skin with a pair of tweezers (some tweezers are made especially for this purpose) without crushing the tick and then disinfect the bite area. One should not use oil or other substances to “suffocate” the tick - this will only cause the tick to expel any pathogens it carries."

        "MedicalCondition": "The infection appears as a painless, moist, firm wound at the location where the bacteria entered the body (usually in the genital area or around the mouth and lips) and as swollen lymph nodes. The wound and swollen lymph nodes disappear within 5 weeks after the infection. After 2-3 months, a skin rash appears and warts develop at the site of infection. This stage can last for up to 5 years and in certain cases the disease goes away on its own. In some cases after 5 years syphilis attacks other organs (such as the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, liver, bones, and muscles) and finally the brain.",

The muscle’s attachment area to the bones will be irritated and inflamed, also affecting the nearby structures (joint capsule).",
        "DescriptionShort": "An epicondylitis radialis humeri describes a condition caused by constant overstrain of the elbow joint by rotation and flexion, that leads to pain in the attachment area of the muscles on the outside of the elbow. It is also commonly known as tennis elbow. Patients experience pain on the outside of the elbow. The area becomes sensitive to pressure. Rotating and flexing the hand becomes very painful and a powerful grip or also wringing out a towel to press out the water will not be or only constrained possible.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Tennis elbow occurs when a muscle is overused and strained. The main cause is frequent contraction of the muscles located in the forearm. People use these muscles to lift and straighten their wrist and hand. The recurrent movements cause a stress to the tissue and this can trigger a sequence of small fissures in the tendons that connect the muscles of the forearm to the bony bulge at the external side of the elbow. Playing tennis, particularly recurrent usage of the backhand thrust with inadequate technique can also cause the condition. Other common movements of the arm are also among the causes. These movements include frequent use of the computer mouse, driving screws, cutting up meat or other ingredients for cooking, painting and using plumbing instruments. The pain connected with the condition may spread from the external side of the elbow into the wrist and forearm. Weakness and pain can make it hard to hold a cup, turn a door handle, grab an object or shake hands.",

Erysipelas is ismilar to cellulitis, which is another skin disorder that ocurs in the lower skin layer with a similar appearance and treatment.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Erysipelas happens when a bacteria called Group A Streptococcus enters the external barrier of a person's skin. Normally, these bacteria live on the skin without causing any harm but they can penetrate the skin through a sore or a cut and cause an infection. Some conditions such as eczema and athlete’s foot may cause breaks in the skin and lead sometimes to erysipelas. The condition can also happen following an infection in the throat and nose that allows the bacteria to spread to nasal passages. Other causes include insect bites, swollen legs due to diabetes and heart failure, and some skin conditions such as psoriasis, injection of illegal drugs such as heroin, surgical incisions, and ulcers in the skin. Typically, symptoms of erysipelas include swollen glands, blisters on the affected area, a painful, swollen, and red area of skin with an elevated edge, feeling generally unwell, chills and fever.

If an operation is not possible due to any number of reasons, another option is to treat the tumor with radiation.  This method is not as guaranteed as surgical removal and after several years the skin may show signs of radiation damage.  If you have basal-cell carcinoma, your doctor can talk to you about which method is the best for you.  Metastasis is very rare for basal-cell carcinoma.  After the tumor excision, relapse is possible, though not frequent.  Furthermore, the risk of developing basal-cell carcinoma in other parts of the body is increased by 50% after having a first tumor.

        "MedicalCondition": "As mentioned, a normal egg cell will be fertilized in the oviduct and then travel from oviduct to the uterus, and implant inside the wall of uterus. However, there are several conditions that can cause the fertilized egg to implant somewhere else but not within the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy happens mostly in the oviduct. Ovary, cervix and abdominal cavity are other places where an ectopic pregnancy may occur. The most common cause is an obstruction (stenosis) of an oviduct, which can prevent the fertilized egg from entering the uterus. Such obstructions occur due to scar formation, typically after infections of the female reproductive system (adnexitis), but also after surgery and after a previous ectopic pregnancy in the oviduct. Another well-known cause is endometriosis, which can increase risks for ectopic pregnancy and other difficulties in pregnancy. The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can be abnormal vaginal bleeding, low back pain, mild cramping on one side of the pelvis and pain in the lower pelvic area. Often this condition will lead to an inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and its typical abdominal pain, which exacerbates on mild pressure of the abdomen and on physical activity. A regular pregnancy test will also be positive in case of an extrauterine pregnancy.",

The common symptoms of cubital tunnel syndrome include numbness or unresponsiveness and tingling in the little finger and ring finger. The nerve runs in a groove on the inner side of the elbow. Baseball pitchers are among the persons who are likely to develop the condition. This is because these players have to twist their hands in order to throw a slider. This motion can injury delicate ligaments that are within the elbow. The entrapment of the ulnar nerve is the second most common cause of nerve entrapment in the body.

There are many conditions that can cause compression of the ulnar nerve. For example, keeping the elbow bent for a long period may compress the ulnar nerve and then lead to ulnar nerve entrapment. In addition, fractures, bone spurs, swelling of the elbow joint, cysts near the elbow joint and repetitive activities may also increase the risk of getting the condition. Since the ulnar nerve can affect movement and sensation, if it is injured an abnormal sensation and weakness in some muscles may occur. The common symptoms include: weakness or muscular atrophy in the hand (especially the abduction of the fourth finger is weakened), tingling or numbness in the palm and fourth or fifth finger, sensitivity to cold and tenderness in the elbow joint.

At certain levels, this accumulation of fluids in the calf is normal when sitting or standing for a long time. But a larger amount of fluid accumulation that does not decrease after walking or lying down should be examined more thoroughly. The reason for increased fluids in tissue is often an overloading of the vascular system, perhaps due to a weak heart (heart failure) or weakness of the leg veins (chronic vein insufficiency).

As a result, there are aberrations in the brain of affected people leading to an overstimulation of motoric regulatory loops with the neurotransmitter dopamine, which then results in the execution of improper behaviors. Generally speaking, Tourette’s syndrome often starts from childhood, and happens to males more often than females.

        "DescriptionShort": "A vertebral fracture is a condition which describes a fracture occurring in the spine. This kind of fracture often results from an accident or bone-related diseases. When a vertebral fracture occurs, it is necessary to consult a doctor immediately. Beside stable fractures of the vertebral body, vertebral fractures will usually need spinal surgery.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The causes of a vertebral fracture include accidents and traumas, such as car or motorbike accidents, a fall from a great height, sports injuries, violent impacts and any other condition that can damage the spinal bones. However, not only accidents and traumas can result in a vertebral fracture, but also bone-related disease such as osteoporosis and bone tumors, especially bone metastases. These kinds of diseases can weaken and damage the structure of the spinal bones and therefore cause or promote fractures. People with a vertebral fracture can experience symptoms like 1) sudden pain of the back, 2) worsening of pain during standing or walking, 3) relief of pain during lying on the back, 4) limitations of spinal movements, 5) height loss, and even 6) deformity and 7) paralyses and loss of sensitivity (paraplegia or quadriplegia).",
        "Name": "Vertebral fracture",
        "PossibleSymptoms": "Back pain,Numbness in the leg,Muscle weakness,Lower-back pain,Immobilization,Curvature of the spine,Delayed start to urination,Bone fracture,Back deformity,Paralysis,Limited mobility of the back",
        "ProfName": "Vertebral body fracture",
        "Synonyms": "Spinal fracture,Spine fracture",
        "TreatmentDescription": "If a vertebral fracture is diagnosed the treatment depends on: 1) the cause of a vertebral fracture, for example, a fracture caused by a trauma or by a disease, 2) the particular fracture pattern. If the fracture is caused by a disease, then besides the fracture, the underlying disease should also be treated. If it is caused by an accident, it is important to avoid moving the patient in order to prevent further damage on the spinal cord. Medications such as steroids and painkillers can reduce the discomfort. A stable fracture can be treated conservatively with rest and immobilization. However, surgery is often necessary to repair the bones and avoid damage on the spinal cord."

        "Description": "Candida is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including the human body. Usually, a person's immune system keeps it under control. However if a person has an immune system deficiency or he is taking antibiotics, the fungus may multiply and cause a local or even systemic infection called candidiasis.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Treatment of candidiasis can be either external or antifungal medications. A specialist will help determine the cause and then offer appropriate treatment.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Candidiasis may occur anywhere in the human body. There are different forms of yeast infection, depending upon the area affected. Most commonly, the mouth, vagina and skin areas are affected, as yeast grows there naturally. For example: 1) thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in the mouth, 2) candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus which makes swallowing hard and painful, 3) women may get vaginitis, which is a vaginal yeast infection, causing itchiness, pain and smelly discharge, 4) yeast infection of the skin cause itching and rashes and 5) yeast infections in your bloodstream may be life-threatening. These only occur if your immune system is deficient like in HIV/AIDS. However local infections often occur after an antibiotics treatment.",

        "Description": "Voice overuse means when people overuse their voice in an inappropriate way, which not only prevents their normal speaking function, but also brings structural changes of the vocal folds in order of that to either acute or chronic symptoms such as hoarseness, loss of voice and laryngeal inflammation.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Voice overuse is when people strain their voice through overuse, which might cause some negative effects on their speaking function. Before voice overuse can be treated, it is important to know the reasons why the voice overuse happened. When symptoms occur, seeing a general practitioner or an otolaryngologist is necessary.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Many people use their voice for work. For example, singers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, sales persons, and public speakers are among those who make great demands on their voices. This puts them at risk for developing voice problems. Besides, there are also some common situations that are associated with voice overuse such as: 1) speaking in noisy environment, 2) using cell phone or telephone excessively, 3) speaking with a pitch that is not appropriate, and 4) not using amplification when speaking in public. Our voice is produced by vibration of the vocal folds, which are two bands of smooth muscle tissue in the larynx. The larynx is located between the base of the tongue and the top of the trachea, which is the passageway to the lungs. Once we use an inappropriate way to speak for too long, it might increase vocal effort and lead to vocal fatigue, hoarseness, vocal cord lesions or hemorrhage and even laryngeal inflammation (laryngitis). If the vocal folds are overstrained for a long time (chronic), vocal fold nodules may occur and leading to permanent hoarseness, foreign body sensation and excessive hawking.",

        "Description": "An infection of the urinary tract can become serious if the kidneys are infected. Irritants include catheter used for a long time, spermicidal jellies or spray for feminine hygiene. Urinary tract infection can result also from another disease. Antibiotics are used usually when the infectious agent is a bacteria. Other types of urinary tract infections are treated according to the underlying trigger. Sometimes, urinary tract infection can improve without treatment. In most cases, the recovery is fast and without complications. Women are at higher risk to develop the condition than men since their urethra is shorter than men’s and the opening is closer to the anus. The urethra is a small tube that transports urine from the bladder. It is possible however less common for an infection to be triggered by radiation therapy or certain medicines.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A urinary tract infection is an infection that affects the urinary bladder or the renal pelvis. The infection is usually caused by intestinal bacteria. Catheters pose a risk of infection as well. Common symptoms include desire to urinate, burning, and frequent urination.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Women are more likely to get a urinary tract infection than men, since the urethra (thus the distance that bacteria have to travel) is shorter in women. Common causes include sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and exposure to cool and wet conditions. Additionally, abnormal draining of the urinary tract may also play a role. The affected person may experience pain, burning, and itching during urination as well as an urge to urinate frequently. However, should the urinary tract infection spread to include the kidneys (known as pyelonephritis), it then becomes a serious illness. Accompanying the above symptoms are fever and side pains.",

        "Description": "The development of the stones is related to increased excretion of components forming stones such as phosphate, xanthine, cysteine, urate, oxalate, and calcium or to a decreased urine volume. Kidney stones are a common cause of pain in the groin, flank, or abdomen, and can cause blood in the urine. Kidney stones occur in 1 out of 20 persons during their lifetime. These stones vary considerably in size from small stones like gravel to big staghorn calculi.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Urinary stones are stones formed in the renal pelvis as kidney stone and then become stuck in the urinary tract. Urinary stones can cause severe, cramping pain.",
        "MedicalCondition": "When kidney stones reach the urinary tract and get stuck (where they are called urinary stones) they can produce severe cramping pain (called renal colic), which can radiate out from flanks to belly or groin. Movement of the stones along the urinary tract lead to small injuries of the mucus membrane in the urinary tract, which causes bleeding and can turn urine light pink.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Treatment consists of reducing pain with medication and observing the patient. Small urinary stones generally flow out on their own and can be “forced” out with the urine. Larger stones, however, need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope. Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine stagnation, leading to infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys."
