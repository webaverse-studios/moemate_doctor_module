        "Description": "Reflux disease is very common worldwide. It is usually due to a backflow of stomach acid through a weakened esophagus. If this occurs regularly, it will develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease, a burning of the mucous membrane in the esophagus.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease is often referred to as gastric or acid reflux disease, as this is the most common complaint. The cause of this symptom is a backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which then causes a burning sensation (hence the name).",
        "MedicalCondition": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs in about 20% of the population in industrial countries. The main symptom is a dull burning, or feelings of pain or pressure in the throat and chest areas, which is where it gets the common name heartburn. It frequently occurs when lying down (at night for example), after copious eating, or after consumption of alcohol and can become noticeable as a chronic cough.",

        "ProfName": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease",
        "Synonyms": "GERD",
        "TreatmentDescription": "In certain cases, damage to the mucous membrane in the throat can become permanent (Barrett’s esophagus) which requires regular check-ups with a specialist, since this damage can degenerate. For people suffering from this, it’s recommended that they maintain a low-fat diet, avoid eating meals late at night, quit smoking and using alcohol, and in the case of overweight patients a reduction in weight it recommended. Medications that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, for example) have been shown to be effective, but they do not treat the cause of the reflux of acid. Furthermore, a test to discover if a stomach infection of Helicobacter pylori is at play may be appropriate, since this can cause or intensify heartburn. In most cases this can be cured with a treatment of antibiotics."

        "Description": "Tobacco consumption is among the main causes for diseases and death around the world. However related diseases and death can be prevented. Tobacco consumption causes numerous different cancers and chronic diseases affecting the life length such as bronchitis and emphysema. Tobacco use causes also heart diseases, issues related to pregnancy, affects negatively the respiratory system, and causes numerous other severe health issues. Even people who don’t smoke are in danger when they are around smokers. A study reported that nonsmokers increase considerably their risk to have lung cancer and heart disease when they are around people who are smoking.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Smoking affects many organs of the body negatively, including important ones such as the lungs, heart, and brain. It’s been shown that tobacco consumption damages these organs, especially the lungs, but also the mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, and nose as well as negatively affects the blood circulation, and with that the heart and the brain. Smokers can consequently suffer from lung cancer, heart attacks, or strokes. Smokers die on average 13-14 years earlier than non-smokers.",
        "MedicalCondition": "As a consequence of using tobacco products, smokers have a higher chance of developing cancer (usually lung cancer), of having a (fatal) heart attack, suffering from a stroke, and developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because lung cancer (see: lung carcinoma) often does not cause any complaints until late, it is often discovered at a stage, where the disease can no longer be cured. Damage to the organs is caused by various highly poisonous substances that are found in tobacco smoke. Smoking not only does the smoker harm, but also people in their surroundings due to passive smoking. It should be noted that even tobacco smoke that is passively inhaled contains poisonous substances that are even more concentrated than smoke that passes through a filter. It is extremely dangerous for nursing babies and small children.",

This condition is characterized by an increase in impulsive motility or contractions of muscles located in the large and small intestines. Such contraction or motility is known as spasm and connected to irritable bowel syndrome. However, the condition can also be connected to a decrease in motility. This makes the name spastic colon less accurate. The severity and cause of the condition is not always the same among patients. The objective of the treatment will be to alleviate symptoms by improving lifestyle and taking certain medications.",

        "Description": "The inflammation of the middle ear, which lies between the external auditory canal and the inner ear, is called otitis media. Anyone can experience otitis media but the condition is most common in children between six and fifteen months old. According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Otitis media, is an inflammation of the middle ear, which is located between the external auditory canal with the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and the inner ear. The inflammation causes swelling and redness followed by a gathering of liquid behind the eardrum.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Pathogens (viruses and bacteria) may induce inflammation of the middle ear, which is especially common in children.  The inflammation is typically experienced as an (pulsating) earache and fever and usually heals on its own within a week.  This type of inflammation is different from long term (chronic) middle ear infections that affect either the mucus membranes or the bones of the middle ear (a disease called cholesteatoma) which generally leads to lasting damage of the eardrum.",

Some mineral and vitamin deficiencies, blood diseases, trauma, Crohn’s disease, and allergies cause similar ulcers. Aphthous stomatitis sores are confused often with cold sores that are caused by a herpes virus. According to its size and further characteristics, aphthous stomatitis can be classified into three types. First of all, if the sore is smaller than one centimeter, then it is called minor aphthous stomatitis. Second, if the sore is bigger than one centimeter, then it is called major aphthous stomatitis. The major type also includes more than one lesion at the time, longer duration than 10 days and eventually even scars after healing. Third, if the sores are extremely small but somehow they merge together, then it is called herpetiform aphthous stomatitis, this name is due to its similar look to a herpes simplex virus infection. People with aphthous stomatitis will feel pain or tingling inside their mouth, which may cause a difficulty to speak normally or to eat. The affected person may feel a tingling or burning sensation in an inflammed area right before the appearance of the ulcer. In order to form fully, an ulcer takes 2 to 3 days. The sores are symmetric, shallow and round. This means that the sores are the same on all sides and are painful. The painful phase lasts three to ten days.

        "Description": "Aortic valve stenosis describes an obstruction of the heart ventricular flow which is caused by a narrowing of the outflow tract of the heart. Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.",

The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Myopia, known also as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is a condition that occurs when the light concentrates in front of the eye, rather on the retina.

        "MedicalCondition": "In case of myopia, the ball of the eye is relatively too long to concentrate the power of the lens and cornea of the eye. This causes rays of the light to come together not directly on the surface of the retina, but at a spot in front of it. The condition occurs also when the lens or cornea is too bent for the length or size of the eyeball. Myopia happens also in some cases when these two factors are combined. The condition starts typically in childhood and people with parents suffering from myopia are more likely to develop the condition. In most cases, myopia stabilizes at the beginning of adulthood but can progress sometimes with age. People with shortsightedness find it hard to see clearly distant objects and read correctly road signs. However, these people can read easily close writings and use computer. Other symptoms and signs of short-sightedness include headaches, squinting, and eye strain. When the condition is not corrected, the person can feel tired when playing sports or driving.

The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structures, which happens in the pelvis.

An immediate medical treatment is necessary when pelvic fractures happen.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The causes of pelvic fractures include: 1) Avulsion fracture: these fractures usually occur when there is a sudden muscle contraction happening. Some pieces of pelvic bones will be torn away by the contractions of muscles. 2) Osteoporosis: elder people with osteoporosis have higher risks of getting pelvic fractures. Osteoporosis can result in the fractures because of the weakened bony structure. However, it will not damage the whole structure of the pelvic ring, but certain weak parts of the pelvic bones. 3) High-energy forces: this is the most common reason of getting pelvic fractures. For example, car accidents, a sudden high-energy force or fall from a height. The type of pelvic fracture can be very dangerous. It is very important to seek a medical treatment immediately.

The theory of accumulation of lactic acid being responsible for pain seems disproven since the amount of pain does not correlate with the amount of lactic acid. Furthermore, at the time the pain occurs, the accumulated lactic acid is already degraded for the most part. More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence.

People with an overactive bladder may have symptoms like 1) frequent urination with sudden urge, 2) difficulty in emptying the bladder completely, 3) inability to urinate deliberately.  People with an underactive bladder may have symptoms like 1) full bladder and urine leakage in drops (overflow bladder), 2) tenderness of the bladder, 3) difficulty in emptying the bladder deliberately, and 4) urine retention. All types of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions lead to difficulties in emptying the bladder completely, which highly increase the risk for an infection of the bladder.",
        "Name": "Nerve-related bladder dysfunction",
        "PossibleSymptoms": "Feeling of residual urine,Urination during the night,Dribbling after urination,Delayed start to urination",
        "ProfName": "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in women",
        "Synonyms": null,
        "TreatmentDescription": "The treatments of a neurogenic bladder dysfunction include medication, catheterization or surgery. Medications for neurogenic bladder dysfunction relax the muscles, decrease the obstruction, and strengthen the muscle strength of the bladder. If necessary, surgery can be considered. Following certain treatments, physical therapy is often necessary for an improvement of bladder function. In severe cases only catheterization can help the patient to gain control of the urinary habits."

        "Description": "Kidney failure is a condition where the kidney loses normal functions. It can be classified as either acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure develops rapidly but might be curable and reversible. Chronic kidney failure usually develops gradually over years and it is not reversible.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A kidney failure is present when the kidney is severely damaged and can therefore no more fulfill its task. Depending on how rapidly it developed, it is classified as either acute or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure occurs within hours or days and may be cured, but once it becomes chronic then it will most likely be permanent. People with chronic kidney failure therefore may need dialysis regularly or accept a kidney transplant.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Kidney failure can be either acute or chronic. The causes of acute kidney failure are usually due to sudden damage to the kidney such as 1) a traumatic injury with high blood loss, 2) a sudden reduction in blood flow to the kidneys, 3) shock or sepsis, 4) obstruction of the urinary system, 5) damage from certain drugs or toxins, and 6) pregnancy complications. Chronic kidney failure develops gradually on the basis of certain disease. For example, the causes of chronic kidney failure include 1) immune system diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C, 2) urinary tract infection such as pyelonephritis, 3) chronic inflammation of the kidneys, 4) polycystic kidney disease, 5) congenital defects, 6) drugs and toxins, 7) diabetes and high blood pressure. People with kidney failure may have excessive accumulation of fluid in the body, and have symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, seizure, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and headache. It can also result in a loss of consciousness. Untreated, a kidney failure may lead to death.",
        "Name": "Renal failure",
        "PossibleSymptoms": "Urination during the night,Increased urine quantity,Increased thirst,Nausea,Leg swelling,Yellow colored skin",
        "ProfName": "Renal insufficiency in women",
        "Synonyms": "Kidney failure",
        "TreatmentDescription": "The treatment of kidney failure will depend on the conditions. An acute kidney failure will be treated according to the causes. For example, if it is caused by an infection, then antibiotics and a temporary dialysis can help the kidney to recover. However, if the kidney failure is chronic, the kidney will not gain back its function and the treatment may include substitutive procedures such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation."

        "Description": "A muscular dystrophy is generally caused by a hereditary disease, which leads to a progressive weakening of muscles. The typical forms of the muscle loss are the ones of the type Duchenne and Becker. Muscular dystrophy affects predominantly the muscles of the thigh, the pelvis and the shoulder. However also other muscles as an example the ones of the heart can be affected.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Muscular dystrophy comprises of a group of illnesses of the muscles. These lead to muscle weakness and to a breakdown of the essential skeletal muscles. The disease can be diagnosed with help of a muscle biopsy.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Muscular dystrophies are generally inherited and affect one in 5'000 primarily boys, in rare cases muscular dystrophies can also develop after a spontaneous mutation. Cause of the condition is the lack of proteins, which are necessary for the muscular metabolism. The gene defect mostly leads already at birth to a situation where these proteins are not available or only in a too low amount. With the two most common prevalent types Duchenne and Becker there is a lack of the dystrophin protein. It can usually be found in the muscle fiber membrane. When it lacks, it leads to a collapse of the muscle cell due to instabilities in the structure. This again leads to muscular weakness and ultimately to a muscle loss in the affected area.",
        "Name": "Progressive muscle weakness",
        "PossibleSymptoms": "Muscle weakness,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Tiredness,Muscle stiffness,Enlarged calf,Difficulty to learn,Difficulty with gait",
        "ProfName": "Muscular dystrophy",
        "Synonyms": null,
        "TreatmentDescription": "Besides a muscle loss it leads also to a deformation of bones and to deformities of the joints, which impair ordinary movements. For this reason, a suspicion for a muscular dystrophy diagnosis persists, when children show uncommon muscular weakness and problems with movement. A final diagnosis can be made in a first step with laboratory tests and ultimately with a muscle biopsy. In this particular case one can detect an increase of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood. Due to the muscle cell destruction it comes to a release of these enzymes, which occur in the skeletal and heart muscles. A muscle biopsy can provide the evidence with help of tissue removal from the affected muscles. A treatment targets to a relief of the symptoms and to a preservation of the important functions of the affected muscles as long as possible."
