        "Description": "Flu is a disease of the human's respiratory system. It is highly contagious and spreads usually by the sneezes and coughs of an infected person. People can also catch a flu by shaking hands of an infected person. Adults are contagious one to two days before getting symptoms and up to seven days after becoming sick. This means that people can spread the virus before they even know that they are infected. More than 200'000 people are hospitalized every year due to complications from a flu and thousands die every year as a result of it. A flu epidemic can last numerous weeks in a country.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Flu (often referred as influenza), is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, throat, and respiratory tract by an influenza or parainfluenza virus. It’s seasonal, often occurring in winter, and can spread rapidly, called then flu epidemic. Swine flu and bird (avian) flu are specific strains of flu.",
        "MedicalCondition": "When the infection occurs in healthy young people, it is usually not dangerous and lasts around one or two weeks. In some cases a dry cough may develop and last a bit longer. Elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses have a higher risk for complications. For this reason it’s recommended that these groups get vaccinated. Swine and bird flus are caused by slight different influenza viruses, but causing similar symptoms. Flu typically develops rapidly, with fever (sometimes accompanied with chills), muscle pain, headache, a dry and painful cough, sore throat, and exhaustion or fatigue. It’s important to note that the flu is different from the common cold, which is often also caused by a virus, but causes milder symptoms.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Even today flu can have fatal consequences for those with pre-existing conditions and requires a hospital stay with emergency medical measures. Normally it is self-limited and the body recovers by itself. A doctor may prescribe medication to help shorten the course of the flu if taken early. Bed rest and staying hydrated are usually sufficient. Medications such as Ibuprofen or Aspirin can lower a fever and relieve symptoms, but they will not shorten the course of the illness and should be used in children with caution. Flu vaccine is recommended for the following groups at risk:  nursing infants, people over 60, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women."

        "Description": "High blood pressure, also known as arterial hypertension, is the state of  constant high pressure in the blood vessels, specifically the arteries. According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.",
        "DescriptionShort": "High blood pressure is a chronic increase in the pressure in certain blood vessels, which can be dangerous, as it can lead to permanent damage of vital organs such as the brain, heart or eyes.",
        "MedicalCondition": "High blood pressure is common and usually goes unnoticed by the affected individual. For this reason, periodically having your blood pressure taken at a check-up by an expert (such as a doctor or nurse) is highly recommended.

        "Description": "Glaucoma is a disease that is common and occurs usually when the liquid in the eye is unable to drain correctly. This causes an increase of the pressure in the affected eye and affects the optic nerve. Many people will not realize that their eye is affected because Glaucoma is sometimes without symptoms at the beginning. People of all age groups can be affected, including  young children and babies, however the condition is most common in old people after they have reached 70.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Glaucoma is a disease of the eye. Glaucoma is caused by damage to the optic nerve, usually from high intraocular pressure, which can lead to partial or complete blindness.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The most common cause of glaucoma is high intraocular pressure, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve. Additionally, people with relatives with glaucoma, diabetes, heavily fluctuating blood pressure, and old age have a higher risk of developing glaucoma. The majority of glaucoma causes develop over a period of time, and patients seldom perceive a reduction of their field of vision.

Too much food, or eating too fast is suspected to cause hiccups, as well as fast drinking, cold or gassy drinks, or, very traditional, somebody is thinking of you. In these cases, the hiccups don’t last long and disappears spontaneously. However, there are also some documented causes for hiccups, including concussion and irritation of the diaphragm nerves. A heart attack can also cause hiccups, as does pancreatitis. Heartburn is also a common cause for hiccups. In some cases, hiccups can last for days, up to years, often caused by heartburn or sometimes concussion. But in most cases the cause is unknown.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Hiccups are a reflexive contraction of the diaphragm, causing a fitful inhalation of air. The inhaling process is stopped by a quick closure of the vocal folds, so that the typical “hic” can be heard. It can be caused by an irritation of the diaphragm because of extreme stomach filling, cold, gassy drinks, consumption of alcohol or inflammable irritations.",
        "MedicalCondition": "With repeated reflexive inhaling, talking becomes difficult. Long-term forms can cause various complications such as sleeping disorders, hypoxia and depressions. The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include swallowing air with sucking on candy or chewing gum, sudden changes of temperature, emotional stress or excitement as well as eating and drinking too much alcohol or carbonated beverages. Hiccups that last over 48 hours can be triggered by different factors including irritation or nerve damage, central nervous system disorders such as tumors, traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, meningitis and encephalitis. Drugs and medical disorders such as with tranquilizers, steroids, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes, barbiturates, anesthesia, and alcoholism can cause also long-term hiccups. The only sign is the characteristic sound of a hiccup. Sometimes, the only symptom is a little tightening feeling in the throat, chest or abdomen that precedes the sound.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Because the cause is unknown in most cases, usually only the symptoms of hiccups can be treated, if necessary. Treatment can include a variety of home remedies, such as holding breath for a long time or exhaling into a paper bag. A variety of medication can be taken for chronic hiccups, but which one leads to the desired success has to be identified by trial-and-error. If the cause is known (e.g. heartburn), it can be treated (e.g. gastric acid blockers). Once the heartburn subsides, the hiccups will subside as well. Hiccups are generally harmless, but can be burdensome for the patient."

The disorders which lead to a heart failure cannot all completely be healed, however the right treatment plan can help to alleviate the symptoms and signs of a heart failure. This in turn can help the patient to live longer than it would be the case without a treatment. With heart failure, blood moves at a slower rate through the heart and body, triggering an increase of the pressure in the heart.

        "TreatmentDescription": "The treatment of a foreign body stuck in the throat is mainly to remove the lodged object as soon as possible. The Heimlich maneuver is the first aid needed in such a situation. The applied pressure on the abdomen will increase the air pressure in the lungs and airways, which hopefully will clear the airways. Also the mouth and throat should be checked for an object that may be able to be removed manually. If it is too difficult to force the foreign body out, then it is strongly recommended to seek prompt medical help. In severe cases, surgery to remove the stuck object is necessary."

        "Description": "All cardiomyopathies have in common, that a malfunction of the heart develops. These are usually pump dysfunctions that, depending on the type of cardiomyopathy, either cause lesser amounts of blood being pumped into the body circulation due to the heart muscle’s insufficient strength, or lesser amounts of blood being pumped into the lung circulation due to e.g. the respective heart cavity became too small.",
        "DescriptionShort": "The condition of cardiomyopathy combines a number of heart-muscle conditions that lead to a decreasing functioning of the heart, therefore developing a cardiomyopathy.",
        "MedicalCondition": "There are 5 main types of cardiomyopathy. A dilative cardiomyopathy (“sacculation“ and enlargement of the heart, so that lesser amounts of blood are being pumped into the body circulation) occurs due to genetic factors, as part of circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease) and heart attack, following virus infections. Patients suffer from breathlessness, cardiac arrhythmia and general symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leads to a thickening musculature mainly of the left heart, without gaining any strength. On the contrary, muscle strength rather decreases! The result is a decrease in the amount of blood being pumped into the body circulation, due to the reduced muscle strength (non-obstructive type) or due to movements/tightening of the blood’s path (obstructive type). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also shows symptoms such as breathlessness under strain, cardiac arrhythmia and the general symptoms mentioned above. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very stiff. It can’t be filled with the sufficient amount of blood anymore, and the blood accumulates in front of the heart. This also leads to breathlessness, but also to an enlarged liver and spleen and may cause dysfunctions. Patients also suffer from swollen and heavy legs. The fourth type is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. When suffering from this type, heart muscle tissue is being more and more replaced by fatty and connective tissue. This tissue is less durable and tends to sag out, similar to the dilative cardiomyopathy. Fatty and connective tissue also doesn’t have the functions of muscle tissue and can’t contract to pump blood into the circulation. Patients suffer from short periods of unconsciousness, irregular heartbeat and heart palpitations. The fifth type is non-classifiable cardiomyopathies. All types can lead to sudden cardiac death.",

        "Synonyms": null,
        "TreatmentDescription": "Some examinations are required to identify the type of cardiomyopathy. The symptoms provide a first idea. One of the first measures is usually an ECG and the analysis thereof, followed by chest x-rays as well as a heart ultrasound. The blood parameters will be determined, and a catheter examination of the heart or a sample taking may be considered as well. Therapy and prognosis depend on the identified type of cardiomyopathy. All measures include omission of substances or habits that can damage the heart (alcohol, smoking, certain medication), as well as rest. Cardiac insufficiency will be treated as well, but with different approaches. Additional specific measures are necessary for the respective types. This may include therapy of the underlying cause, pacemaker implantation, surgeries or even a heart transplant. The doctor will discuss the individual therapy with the patient. All cardiomyopathies are serious conditions that can strongly impair the patients’ daily activities and require intensive therapy, depending on the stage of severity. Despite all options, sudden cardiac death or other life-threatening complications occur frequently."
