        "Description": "Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which the body’s release of the hormone insulin is either reduced or the effectiveness of the hormone is reduced. The pancreas is responsible for the constant production of insulin.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Diabetes is a disease in which the level of blood sugar remains high, which can lead to damage of the smaller blood vessels, which in turn can damage various organs such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Diabetes due to a reduced release of or total lack of insulin is referred to as Type-1 diabetes (formerly juvenile diabetes mellitus) and is actually an autoimmune disease. Here, the body’s defense system turns against the body itself. The resulting reduced efficiency of the insulin is referred to as Type-2 diabetes (formerly called adult onset diabetes).",

        "TreatmentDescription": "It’s important to note that blood sugar levels that remain high lead to damage in small blood vessels in various organs including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves that contribute to tactile sensation. This damage of the vessels leads to damage in these organs. Injury to nerves in the hands and feet is often referred to as polyneuropathy. The treatment of diabetes is carried out through regularly checking blood sugar levels and through medication. When it comes to medication, either insulin shots are administered or in the case of Type-2 diabetes it may be enough to take medications that strengthen the effect of insulin or insulin production. Regular and consistent testing of your average blood sugar levels over a period of 3 months with an HbA1c test by your doctor is important, as well as regular eye examinations by your ophthalmologist."

Overproduction or improper cleaning, e.g. with cotton swabs, can cause the earwax to gather in front of the eardrum where it may dry out and block the ear canal.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Cerumen obturans is the medical term for earwax. It is mainly used when the ear canal is blocked with earwax, which can cause sudden hearing problems and ringing in the ears.",
        "MedicalCondition": "A sudden hearing impairment of one ear is the main symptom for cerumen obturans. The hearing impairment often occurs after the ear canal has been in contact with water, because dried earwax soaks with water, expands and therefore closes the ear canal completely. Another common symptom is ringing in the ears (tinnitus). This can also be caused by earwax closing the outer ear canal.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "Descriptions of the symptoms lead the doctor to an assumption that will be verified by an endoscopy of the ear canal. The earwax will then be removed from the ear canal. There are various ways to remove it, such as suction, rinsing with warm water or usage of hydrogen peroxide. To prevent the build-up of earwax into an impaction it’s suggested to avoid cleaning the ears with cotton swabs, but to rinse it regularly. This is preferred to be done by a doctor, because the eardrum and middle ear may become damaged if removal is not professionally executed."

        "Description": "Obesity is defined by a BMI (body mass index) value of 30 or higher. Obesity is widespread in developed countries and is one of the three most avoidable conditions and causes of death. Obesity usually develops as a result of over-eating, meaning that the amount of food consumed exceeds the amount of calories used. Additionally, physical inactivity and psychological factors such as stress, frustration, and sadness play a role. Obesity is rarely the result of other conditions or a side effect of medication (such as cortisone).",
        "DescriptionShort": "Obesity describes a condition of a person who is extensively overweight due to increased body fat. Obesity is defined by a BMI (body mass index) value of 30 or higher. BMI is a measure of whether a person has a healthy weight for his height. Obesity in the vast majority of cases is caused by overeating and physical inactivity.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Obesity is caused generally by consuming more than needed calories, especially those contained in sugary and fatty food. These calories are burnt off through physical activity and the body stores the excess energy as fat. The condition is an increasingly common issue since many people living in modern societies eat excessive quantities of high-calorie, cheap food while spending a lot of time sitting in cars, on couches or at desk. Some underlying health conditions can contribute also to weight gain, as an example hypothyroidism. However these conditions usually do not cause problems if they are controlled effectively with medication. Some of the signs of obesity include a higher than normal waist circumference and body mass index, having additional fat around the waist, clothes are feeling tight and the person needs a larger size of clothes. In addition, the scale shows that the person has gained weight. In some cases, metabolic syndrome may occur simultaneously.

It’s important for the affected individual to acknowledge the significance of their obesity and cooperate enthusiastically with their treatment. Treatment usually consists of a long-term change in diet that includes a reduction in calorie intake, regular physical activity, and behavioral group therapy. Certain medications can also be prescribed to aid weight loss. The goal of therapy is not to lose weight quickly, but slowly and permanently. In exceptional and extreme cases of obesity (morbid obesity - BMI of 40 kg/m2 or higher), treatment via gastric bypass surgery can be discussed as an option."

        "Description": "Inside of the eye is the retina, in which optical perception takes place. In order for observed objects to be imaged correctly on the retina, the light that enters the eye needs to be refracted exactly on the surface of the retina. This refraction is achieved with help from the lens, which controls how much the light from an object is refracted depending on its distance. If this refraction is too weak or if the eyeball is too short, objects nearby may not be perceived clearly.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Farsightedness or hyperopia is a vision condition in which the patient can see distant objects clearly but cannot focus properly to close ones. The patient perceives objects that are closer as blurry. Hyperopia occurs when the cornea has too little curvature or the eyeball is too short, making it hard for the eye to focus the light correctly which penetrates it.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Farsightedness is relatively common and usually happens in the context of presbyopia, which becomes more common with age. Patients notice that the closer an observed object is to the eye, the blurrier it seems to be. One of the causes of farsightedness is a flat cornea. Further causes can be a short eyeball which is shorter than normal, that can cause the light to concentrate behind the eye's retina rather than on it. Family history is also among the causes of farsightedness. The condition develops often in adults as the lenses of the eyes age. It is difficult for people with farsightedness to see anything up close. They have to work hard in order to see close things and this causes strain in the eyes. This extra strain causes some symptoms of farsightedness. The symptoms include blurry vision up close, fatigue, tension, squinting in order to see better, a burning or aching sensation around the eyes, and a headache after tasks such as reading that require to concentrate on something up close. When the condition has not been corrected and diagnosed properly in children, some of them may develop strabismus or crossed eyes.",

        "Synonyms": "Longsightedness,Farsightedness",
        "TreatmentDescription": "The eyes of young people can compensate for farsightedness since their lenses are still flexible. This is hard for aging eyes that require glasses for close-up tasks including sewing or reading. The condition can be corrected in the simplest way by getting prescription contact lenses or eyeglasses with converging lenses (“plus” lenses). Such lenses or eyeglasses are corrective as they change the way light enters the eyes and compensating the insufficient refractive power of the lens, helping the patient to concentrate better. Another way to treat farsightedness is refractive surgery that may cause some severe complications."

Treatment should be started immediately; otherwise the affected eye might go blind. For smaller detachments it might be sufficient to stick the retina together in their immediate environment, for bigger detachments, a more comprehensive surgery might be indicated. For more complicated retinal detachments, the removal of the vitreus body could become necessary. Generally, about 95% of retinal detachments can be treated without severe complications. Especially in case of spontaneous retinal detachments, the other eye might get affected after some time, an ophthalmologist regularly for check-ups."

        "MedicalCondition": "Epilepsy occurs in 0.5% of the population. Seizures occur in different frequencies and at different intervals. Patients usually experience warning signs before a seizure such as nausea, feeling hot, or unusual and indescribable feelings. Sleep deprivation and alcohol withdrawal as well as hard breathing can trigger a seizure. A Grand Mal seizure is the most common form of epilepsy and presents as loss of consciousness, falling, muscle cramps, and muscle convulsions. After several minutes, a period of confusion and drowsiness follows until the patient regains normal awareness. The patient cannot remember the event. During the seizure the patient may bite their tongue, urinate, or defecate. In contrast, an absence seizure presents as an acute disruption in awareness without a deeper loss of consciousness and usually occurs in children and youth. It can manifest as discreet signs such as blinking, slight twitching, or absent-mindedness. Absence seizures usually occur several times a day and can be triggered by quick breathing. Simple focal seizures involve muscle twitching that it limited to a specific area or sensations on the skin. Acoustic and visual sensitivity can also be symptoms of epilepsy. Patients often remain conscious. Complex focal seizures involve déjà vu phenomena, feeling of insubstantiality, hallucinations or even heart-racing and difficulty in breathing.

The underlying cause of portal hypertension, and therefore of esophageal varices, are mostly liver-related problems, for example, more than forty percent of people with esophageal varices have liver cirrhosis. Liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, infection of the liver and fatty liver can all end into cirrhosis. In addition, thrombosis of the portal vein is also a common reason. Thrombosis of the portal vein is a condition when there is a blood clot stuck in the portal vein and it thereby causes high pressure in the vein which then leads to esophageal varices. Generally speaking, all persons with hypertension of the portal vein, disregarded which cause it has, are at a high risk of getting the disease.

        "Description": "The deformity of the knee joints is a situation when people stand up straight, but the upper and lower leg are not in the same axis. This is either called bow-leg (genu varum, big gap between knees) or knock-knee (genu valgum; knees tight together). Infants and little children often have bow-legs due to the position in the womb and incomplete development of the bones. However, it can be caused by diseases, for example, Rickets and Blount’s disease.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A deformity of knee joints is a situation when people stand up straight, but the axis of the upper and the lower leg still differ. It is thought to be normal for children under the age of 3 years. It is recommended to visit an orthopedist if the condition does not improve or leads to pain.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The causes of this deformity are various. Most commonly the condition occurs with infants and little children. Bowlegs may happen due to the position in the womb and incomplete development of bones. Normally the condition will improve within 3 years after birth. If the condition is not becoming better, then the child is probably bowlegged. Besides, diseases can also cause the deformity of knee joints. For example, an abnormal bone development, fractures, Blount’s disease, poisoning of fluoride and lack of vitamin D (rickets) can cause the problem. A deformity of the knee results in an unilateral overstressing of the knee joint and in order of that to an increased abrasion of the cartilage, which leads to symptoms like knee pain and swelling. Besides, the overstressing promotes the development of arthrosis.",

If the deformity of knee joints is caused by diseases, then the treatment will focus on the underlying problems. Normally, assisting devices such as special braces and orthopedic shoes can be used to adjust the deformity of the knee joints. For severe cases, a surgery might be necessary to adjust the axis of the leg."

        "Description": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder belonging to the group of hypersomnia. It leads to an inability of the brain to regulate the sleep-wake cycles well. People with narcolepsy may have problems like excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy. The excessive daytime sleepiness can result in sudden sleep attacks, which may last from some seconds to minutes, even when persons had enough sleep during night. Narcolepsy can occur at any age.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Narcolepsy describes a chronic neurological disorder leading to an inability of the brain to regulate sleep-wake cycles. The cause of narcolepsy is not well known. It is recommended to consult a neurologist, if respective symptoms appear.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown. Some researches show that narcolepsy may be related to low levels of hypocretin (orexin), which is neurotransmitter in the brain. This may be the reason for the deregulation of the sleep-wake cycles. The low concentration of hypocretin is thought to be associated with a loss of brain cells that produce hypocretin due to some autoimmune reactions. Whether other factors such as vaccinations, a trauma or injury to the brain, tumors in the brain, stress, an irregular sleep schedule, and abuse of medications or any other damage to the brain can result in narcolepsy, is not finally proven. The common symptoms include extreme daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks despite sufficient amount of sleep), cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while retaining consciousness, triggered by a emotional stimulus such as joy or fright), hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations directly after awakening), as well as sleep paralysis (inability to move directly after awakening while fully conscious).",

Individually assessed strategies like daily sleeping episodes or the avoidance of certain situations will help to handle the disease. In addition, medications might be used for the treatment of narcolepsy, for example, 1) stimulant medicines, such as methylphenidate or modafenil, can help to stay awake during the day, 2) antidepressant medicines can help to reduce cataplexy, sleep paralysis and even hallucinations, 3) sodium oxybate can also help to control day time sleepiness and cataplexy.

        "Description": "The esophagus is a long and hollow tube that connects the throat and stomach together, and its function is to transport food into the stomach. The esophagus is made of smooth muscles, which transport the food with peristaltic waves, and an upper and lower sphincter, which close the end of the esophagus if necessary. A dysfunction of the esophagus results from either abnormal muscular contractions of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal function of the upper or lower sphincter.",
        "DescriptionShort": "A dysfunction of the esophagus describes several conditions in which the esophagus cannot function normally. For example, gastroesophageal reflux is one of the common results of a dysfunction of the esophagus. It is recommended to visit a gastroenterologist for a further check if there are any related symptoms.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The causes of a dysfunction of the esophagus could either be an abnormal contraction of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal functioning of the upper or lower sphincter. 1) Dysfunction of the upper parts of the esophagus often results from an excessive muscular contraction of the esophagus (esophagus spasm), which leads to difficulty in swallowing and drinking. Typical symptoms of esophageal spasm are globus sensation in the throat, pain in the chest and regurgitation of food. 2) Dysfunctions of the lower esophagus can result from either a high or a low muscular contraction of the esophagus and its lower sphincter. If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too strong, while the peristaltic smooth muscle waves are too weak, it will prevent the food from passing into the stomach, so it gets stuck in the esophagus (achalasia). Typical symptoms are problems with swallowing, pain in the chest and upper abdomen and regurgitation of food. 3.) If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too weak, it may lead to a flow back of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus, which causes damage on the esophageal mucosa. This is a common problem that is referred to as gastroesophageal reflux. People with gastroesophageal reflux may have symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, painful swallowing or coughing at night. The typical symptom of heartburn means a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or the chest, which worsens after eating and at night while lying horizontally.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "The treatments of a dysfunction of esophagus include medications and rarely a surgery. The treatment will depend on the specific problem. For example, medication such as calcium channel blockers can help to relax the muscles of the esophagus when the dysfunction is caused by intense muscular contractions. And if the dysfunction is caused by weak muscular contractions of the esophagus, which causes the gastroesophageal reflux, it is often treated by medication such as antacids. However, in some severe cases, surgery to repair the function of the esophagus is necessary."

Some of these conditions are, for example, severe pain, psychic stress, a sudden change of position, dehydration, loss of blood and heavy coughing. Certain illnesses such as heart disease, neurologic diseases and metabolic diseases can also cause frequent appearance of syncope. Furthermore, syncope can be the side effect of drug and alcohol abuse or allergy. The symptoms of syncope are typically paleness, vertigo and loss of consciousness. Sometimes syncope is announced by nausea, feeling cold, sweating or blurred vision. Low blood sugar and seizure may also cause a loss of consciousness, but this is not classified as syncope since in these cases the underlying mechanism is not an insufficient blood supply.",

Therefore it is recommended to avoid exposure to excessive noise. If symptoms such as earache, tinnitus and loss of hearing occur, seeing an otolaryngologist is necessary.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The ear consists of three main parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear is built by the auricle and the ear canal. The eardrum separates the outer from the middle ear. Small bones in the middle ear help transfer sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. Here, the vibrations become nerve impulses with the aid of sensory cells. These sensory cells can be damaged by overexposure to noise. Both, acute noise trauma and prolonged exposure to loud noise damage and destroy the sensory cells. As the number of sensory cells decreases, so does the hearing function. There is no way to restore the sensory cells, so the damage is permanent. The louder the noise and the longer someone is exposed to it, the more damage will be caused.
