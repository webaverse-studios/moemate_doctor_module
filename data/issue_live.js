    "Description": "Sinusitis is an inflammation of one or more paranasal sinuses. It can either develop as a common sinus infection (rhinitis, a cold) or less commonly in conjunction with allergies. If sinusitis lasts longer than two months, it is referred to as being chronic. The maxillary sinus is often affected as well in acute or chronic infections. Because of the swelling of the mucosa in the paranasal sinuses, its secretions can no longer flow out properly and they become lodged in the paranasal sinuses. There they can become infected with pathogens (such as viruses).",

    "Description": "Meteorism, called also tympanites, is a condition where the abdomen feels full and tight. In this situation, the abdomen may look swollen and distended. Meteorism is caused by the increase in the quantity of intestinal gas, applying more pressure than usual inside the digestive system and generating various discomforts. Particularly there usually is a rather intense flatulence and pain caused by the elimination process of the gas. Simple dietary changes are usually enough to make the annoying symptoms disappear. Sometimes, doctors can recommend the use of certain drugs.",
    "DescriptionShort": "Meteorism describes the accumulation of gas in the abdomen or in the intestines, accompanied by distention. It is normally not a serious problem. Sometimes, over-the-counter medication is enough to relieve the symptoms. But if meteorism is caused by certain diseases, one should consult a doctor.",
