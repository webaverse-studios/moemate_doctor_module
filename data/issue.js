Medications that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, for example) have been shown to be effective, but they do not treat the cause of the reflux of acid.  Furthermore, a test to discover if a stomach infection of Helicobacter pylori is at play may be appropriate, since this can cause or intensify heartburn.  In most cases this can be cured with a treatment of antibiotics."

    "Description": "When the erectile center in healthy men is stimulated, the blood vessels in the spongy body of the penis open up to increase blood flow. Drainage of blood from the penis is reduced by the closing of the veins, causing an increased amount of blood to accumulate in the penis, from which an erection results.  Other medical conditions such as (a) venal issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and dyslipidemia, (b) an issue with the nerves such as paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, dementia, epilepsy, or (c) hormonal imbalances such as low testosterone or hyperprolactinaemia may be responsible for erectile dysfunction.  Psychological issues such as fear of failing to perform sexually, depression, stressful experiences, and dysfunctional partner relationships can lead to erectile dysfunction. Additionally, it’s possible that nerves responsible for having an erection could have been damaged during a prostate operation or there could be side effects from medication.",

Pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, liver insufficiency, and serious retinal diseases require other treatments.  Other medicinal drugs can be injected directly into the penis.
