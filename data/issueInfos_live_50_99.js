      "Description": "Gray cataract is a disease of the eye. In contrast to the eye lens of a healthy person which is clear the person affected suffers from a misty or cloudy lens, which has become less clear over time that impacts the vision. Cataracts begin to develop sometimes with persons who are getting older and impacts their lens in a way that the light is being stopped to reach the back part of the eye, in specific the retina. This is where the \"seeing\" is happening, meaning that the optical images are converted into signals which then can be transmitted to our visual part of the brain. Cataracts become worse over the time and begin to affect vision. Surgery will be needed eventually to remove and replace the damaged lens.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Gray cataract, also just simply called cataract, is a disease of the eye that leads to a slow clouding of the eye lens. Patients often complain of sensitivity to glare, a reduction in sharpness of vision, or cloudy vision.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The disease usually occurs in advanced age and gradually progresses. The clouding of the lens first leads to disruptive sensitivity to light, especially to glare from backlighting at night time, and later leads to impaired sight. Many patients with cataract report cloudy or obscured vision.",

      "Description": "Patients with bulimia suffer from binge eating, when they “can’t stop eating until everything is gone”, followed by feelings of guilt. Being afraid of weight gain, they will initially induce vomiting using their fingers; later on the vomiting will be reflective. Patients often have a pathological fear of gaining weight. People with bulimia often maintain a normal or slightly reduced weight above a body mass index value of 17.5. Body mass index (BMI) can be calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by body height squared. A normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to bulimia, people with anorexia (see the article on anorexia) have a BMI value under 17.5.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Bulimia nervosa is a psychological disease that predominantly affects young women and shows a disturbed relationship with food intake. Affected people suffer from binge eating followed by vomiting. Instead of vomiting after binge eating, some patients might also misuse laxatives, do excessive exercise, or fast.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Even though patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are often of normal weight, unlike those suffering from anorexia nervosa, they still show strong symptoms of malnutrition. Frequent vomiting leads to bad teeth, with tooth decay and other defects, and they also suffer from stomach complaints and heartburn.

      "Description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition that affects mainly older or middle-aged adults who smoke. Many people do not realize they have it. The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit normal physical activities. An exposure over long time of period to lung irritants such as dust, air pollution or chemical vapours may contribute also to the condition. However,  a suitable treatment can help to keep the condition under control.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease is a long-lasting (chronic) disease which is generally not inflammatory and affects the respiratory tract. It is caused by regular smoking in the majority of cases and can lead to lasting lung damage. As a result of this continuously worsening disease it becomes difficult to breathe for the affected person.",

      "Description": "Colds are very common and widespread and most cases are caused by a virus. Treatment with antibiotics is not advisable, as antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Common cold affects the nose and airways and its symptoms are milder than a flu. A sore throat, pain when swallowing, a runny nose, and a mild fever are typical symptoms.",
      "DescriptionShort": "The cold, or common cold, is an illness mostly caused by a living, tiny organism named a virus. There are more than 200 types of viruses that cause cold but the most common one is the rhinovirus that causes 10 to 40% of colds. Colds are usually harmless even if they might not feel that way.",
      "MedicalCondition": "A cold virus penetrates the human body through a his nose, mouth or eyes. People can catch the disease by sharing objects that have been contaminated by the virus such as toys, telephones, utensils or towels. The virus can also spread by physical touch such as hand-to-hand contact with a contaminated person. The virus may also spread over the air through small drops released when someone who has cold talks, coughs or sneezes. Afterward, if the person touches his eyes, nose or mouth after such exposure or contact, he will likely catch the virus. Children below six years old are at a higher risk of catching the virus. A weakened immune system poses also a risk factor. One can get a cold anytime but both adults and children are more susceptible to catch colds in winter and fall. Smoking can increase the risk of catching severe colds. Common symptoms appear usually within three days following the contact with the virus causing cold. These symptoms can differ from individual to individual and include low-grade fever, sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, a minor headache or minor body aches, cough, and sore throat. As the cold continues, the release from the affected person’s nose can become yellow and thicker or even green but this is not a sign of an infection  caused by the bacteria.",

      "TreatmentDescription": "A cold usually runs its course without lasting harm and then disappears on its own. Rarely it is the start of a serious infection such as a lung infection. Just as with the flu, bed rest and sufficient hydration are recommended. If necessary, fever reducing medication can be taken. Anti-inflammatory nasal sprays and inhalants can provide additional relief. Although an exception to the rule, a bacterial infection may be present alongside a viral infection, in which case a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic."

      "Description": "Chickenpox is an infection by a varicella-zoster virus that commonly affects children and is highly contagious. In fact, the condition is so common in childhood that most of adult persons are immune to it because they have had it before. With some children there are only some spots but with others it can be possible to see their entire body covered with spots. The common areas affected include the legs and arms, especially beneath the arms, the belly and chest, scalp and ears, and the face. Children catch usually chickenpox in winter and spring, between March and May.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Chickenpox is an infection caused by a varicella-zoster virus that is highly contagious. Most cases are in children below the age of 15. It spreads very easily from one person to another. The typical symptom of chicken pox is an itchy, uncomfortable rash. In adults the virus can become active again and lead to shingles.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The highly contagious disease occurs primarily in children and can be seen as a skin rash over the entire body, with small, reddish, and itchy blisters. The risk of infection starts 1 to 2 days in advance to the appearance of blisters until the decrease of crusted wounds (usually 5 to 6 days after the rash has started). After the illness has run its course, the virus continues to reside within the body (inside certain nerve cells) and can become activated again later in life or in individuals with compromised immune systems. This infection is called shingles or herpes zoster and appears as a localized, very painful skin rash. The disease is contagious in people who have not yet had the varicella virus. In older people, pain may continue for several weeks or even months after the rash has disappeared. The disease usually runs its course without complications or consequences. Patients with pre-existing conditions such as neurodermatitis or weak immune systems may have a worse experience. Newborn babies are also greatly at risk of an infection. Chickenpox is considered a moderate disease when it occurs in children, but the affected skin areas can be extremely itchy and the child can have multiple symptoms ranging from fever, to feeling irritable even to feeling miserable.",
      "Name": "Chickenpox",
      "PossibleSymptoms": "Crusting,Earache,Fever,Formation of blisters on a skin area,Itching of skin,Pain radiating to the leg,Skin lesion,Skin rash,Scar,Wound",
      "ProfName": "Varicella zoster virus infection",
      "Synonyms": null,
      "TreatmentDescription": "Chickenpox doesn't have a particular treatment however medication can improve the symptoms. Mostly what happens is that the affected children's blisters start to crust up and then fall off by themselves within a timeframe of up to two weeks. A kid who has the disease should be kept away from public places so that the risk is reduced of infecting other persons who may not have had it. It’s also recommended that contact with pregnant women should be avoided, as an infection early on in the pregnancy or towards the birth can put the baby into serious health risks. Normally the treatment for chickenpox consists of medicine which reduces the urge to itch. Salves can also be used to dry out the blisters. With herpes zoster, anti-viral medication can be used to shorten the duration and intensity of the disease. A vaccine exists for children and youth against varicella and there is also a zoster vaccination for seniors over 60."

      "Description": "Coronary artery disease occurs when the major blood vessels, called coronary arteries, that supply the heart with nutrients, blood and oxygen become diseased or damaged. Deposits containing cholesterol in the arteries and inflammation are usually the reasons behind the condition since these deposits, called plaques, build up and narrow the coronary arteries. This decreases blood flow to the heart, causing shortness of breath, chest pain, or other symptoms and signs of coronary artery disease. A total blockage may trigger a heart attack. It can be difficult to notice the condition since coronary artery disease develops often over decades.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Coronary artery disease is a hardening of the arteries within the arteries of the heart and it leads to a narrowing of the arteries as well as a reduction in the circulation of blood to the muscles of the heart and the symptoms associated with that. Thus it can cause circulatory disorders with accompanying chest pain (angina pectoris), a heart attack, or even sudden death from heart failure. A healthy lifestyle can make a huge contribution to avoid this happening.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Coronary artery disease is common predominantly in developed countries. Risk factors for coronary artery disease and the same as those for arteriosclerosis:  high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, increased blood lipid levels (especially cholesterol), age, heart attacks (in related family members), diabetes, being overweight, a diet rich in calories and fats, lack of exercise, and high levels of stress. Decreased blood supply to the heart muscles leads to symptoms typical of angina pectoris with feelings of tightness in the chest and a pressure on the chest that radiates out to the throat or the left arm. Symptoms may feel similar to those of heartburn. Symptoms usually manifest during periods of effort, psychological stress, or in cold conditions and disappear within 15 minutes.",

      "ProfName": "Coronary artery disease",
      "Synonyms": "CAD,ischemic heart disease,IHD,atherosclerotic heart disease,atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease",
      "TreatmentDescription": "If a plaque built up in a vessel detaches, the coronary artery is then closed and cause a heart attack, which is the dying off of part of the heart’s own muscles caused by lack of blood. Symptoms typically include intense, long-lasting angina pectoris that does not improve, accompanied by nausea, cold sweats, and shortness of breath. In the worst case, a heart attack can lead to death, so if the above mentioned symptoms occur it is an emergency situation and a hospital visit is necessary. In order to prevent coronary artery disease, it’s important to get regular daily exercise, eat a Mediterranean-style diet (little fat, lots of vegetables, fish, and fiber), avoiding nicotine (quitting is best), and keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels in check. To clarify the causes for angina pectoris, you should visit a specialist in cardiology.  Treatment depends on the severity of the disease (see the article on heart attacks)."

Vessel sonography and an x-ray of the veins with contrast agents confirm the diagnosis; identify the affected parts and help planning the therapy. Conservative treatments include support stocking of compression class II, alternatively the legs can be wrapped with short-stretch bandages or a zinc paste bandage. Long standing and sitting should be avoided for the benefit of lying and walking. Kneipp applications (hot/cold sequence showers) support the venous blood return, as well as the activation of the muscle pump, the active ankle movement, whereby the lower leg muscles work and basically “squeeze out” the veins. If an ulcer already exists, it needs to be cleaned and the dead tissue needs to be removed, followed by a frequent and lengthy treatment with wound dressings and compressions. When the ulcer doesn’t heal or gets infected again and again, surgical measures may be considered. A surgical treatment of varicose veins can be an option as well, depending on the stage and the affected areas. Other options can be ligature of all affected veins in the groin (crossectomy), vein stripping, ligature of all connecting veins between superficial and deep venous system, sclerotherapy or laser therapy. Which therapy, if any, is recommended for each case mainly depends on the prior imaging."

The two conditions together are named colorectal cancers. Most cases of colon cancer start as noncancerous, small, benign clumps of cells. In this case, they can produce few, if any, symptoms at all. That is why doctors recommend regular screening tests, which is basically a proactive prevention strategy for colon cancer by having an early detection and if needed removal of clumps of cells before they can become malignant.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Colon cancer is a malignant tumor of the large intestine. It is the second most common cancer in men and women over 50 years old. It attacks surrounding tissues, and cancer cells can migrate into other organs.

Treatment consists of surgical removal with or without chemotherapy or radiation.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Most cases of colon cancer (90%) begin as small, benign accumulations of cells called adenomatous polyps. Over some years, some of these polyps slowly become malignant and turn into colon cancer. Risk factors for colon cancer include: 1) improper diet with high-fat, low fibre and a high intake of red meats, 2) having colorectal polyps, 3) having inflammatory bowel disease, 4) having a positive family history, 5) inherited disease such as familial adenomatous polyposis or 6) long history of smoking or drinking alcohol. People with colon cancer may have symptoms such abdominal pain and tenderness, blood in the stool, diarrhoea, difficult defecation and weight loss without known cause, fever or night sweats. Screenings can help diagnosing colon cancer in an early stage. Those are physical examinations with rectal palpations as well as regular colonoscopies for persons above the age of 50.

      "TreatmentDescription": "Treatments of colon cancer depend on the stage of the cancer and include: 1) Surgery with complete removal of the cancer cells: Early stage (Stage 0) colon cancer may be removed by colonoscopy to eliminate the cancer cells. For stages 1, 2, and 3, a more invasive surgery known as a partial colon resection is required to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. 2) Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells: patients with stage 3 colon cancer normally receive chemotherapy for 6-8 months after surgery. It is also used to reduce symptoms and to prolong the survival of patients with stage 4 colon cancer. 3) Radiation therapy to destroy the cancerous tissue is usually used in the presence of rectal cancers to reduce their size before surgery. Most important in prevention of colorectal cancer is a regular check-up with a colonoscopy for people older than 50 years."

Other causes may comprise arthritis, other syndromes or illnesses such as Marfan syndrome and cerebral palsy. Inappropriate shoes that do not fit correctly can contribute to the occurrence of the condition since tight shoes may rub against the big toe joint and high-heeled shoes may squeeze the feet, causing the big toe to be stuck in a leaned position. Such position keeps the big toe stretched. The nerve around the big toe will be pressured, triggering pain. In addition, high heels push most of the body weight forward onto the front part of the foot, which puts significant strain on the joints of the toe. The main symptom of the condition is the big toe directing in the way of the other toes present on the same foot. This may lead to the foot bone linked to the big toe to point outwards. Secondary symptoms may comprise sore skin above the upper part of the hallux valgus, red, callused and hard skin generated by the overlapping of the great toe and the following toe, swelling and pain on the joint of the great toe. Changes to the form of the foot may make it hard to find appropriate shoes and wearing shoes may then trigger a pressure that makes the pain worse.

Crohn’s disease is usually diagnosed with a colonoscopy or gastroscopy, where mucous membrane samples are collected and examined. Crohn’s disease is a lengthy, incurable disease. Treatment aims at suppressing the body’s defence system to alleviate the enteritis and with it the symptoms. Surgeries are often necessary to remove strongly damaged intestinal sections."
