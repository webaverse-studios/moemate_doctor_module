    "Description": "Sinusitis is an inflammation of one or more paranasal sinuses. It can either develop as a common sinus infection (rhinitis, a cold) or less commonly in conjunction with allergies. If sinusitis lasts longer than two months, it is referred to as being chronic. The maxillary sinus is often affected as well in acute or chronic infections. Because of the swelling of the mucosa in the paranasal sinuses, its secretions can no longer flow out properly and they become lodged in the paranasal sinuses. There they can become infected with pathogens (such as viruses).",
    "DescriptionShort": "Sinusitis occurs when the cavities of the nose become inflamed and swollen. The condition is usually caused by a virus and  improves often within a short period of time maximum up to three weeks. It is less commonly coming in combination with an allergy.",
    "MedicalCondition": "Sinusitis is relatively common. People with sinusitis often experience pressing or pulsating headaches around the forehead and eyes, which become stronger when bending forward.

    "Description": "Anorexia, also called anorexia nervosa, is a psychological disease in which affected persons suffer from a disturbed body perception. This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.",
    "DescriptionShort": "People with anorexia suffer from a misperception of their own body. These are mainly young women. Even though they are much too thin, they perceive themselves as “too fat” and unattractive. \nAnorexia is characterized by a severe restriction of nutrition and an intentionally induced underweight state with the patients trying to lose even more weight.",
    "MedicalCondition": "Women are affected most often, but not exclusively. As mentioned above, patients’ symptomatology or behaviour often begins with monitoring their food intake with calorie charts. This is then often followed by measures to significantly reduce weight, including excessive exercise, vomiting, laxatives, but also consumption of appetite suppressants as well as foregoing many foods. Affected persons do not like to eat in company anymore and will take a very long time to eat even smallest amounts of food.",

    "ProfName": "Anorexia nervosa",
    "Synonyms": null,
    "TreatmentDescription": "The insufficient supply with calories, but more importantly with vitamins and other essential nutrition can cause serious or even life-threatening physical symptoms. A low body weight can lead to hormonal disorders, such as irregularity or absence of menstruation. Men with anorexia may experience loss of potency and sexual drive. When the body fails to receive sufficient nutrition, bones can no longer rebuild themselves, which can lead to the early development of chronic osteoporosis. In rare cases it can lead to a reduced heart rate and body temperature, which requires an urgent trip to the hospital. Treatment of anorexia requires a specialist and is extremely important, as undernourishment can be fatal under certain circumstances. Treatment often occurs over a long period of time and relapse is common. In the event of acute life-threatening weight loss, induced nutrition, e.g. via a gastric tube or high-calorie drinks will be the initial treatment, followed by intensive psychotherapy and nutritional counselling."

    "Description": "Alzheimer’s, disease, predominantly affects older people and is characterized by an advanced loss of brain cells and the resulting inability of the patient to demonstrate higher mental functions. People with Alzheimer’s disease have also a shortage of some major chemical messengers in their brain. These messengers help to transmit signals around the brain and when there is a shortage of them, the transmission of signals is not effective.",
    "DescriptionShort": "Alzheimer’s disease, named after the doctor who first describes it (Alois Alzheimer), is a mental disease that affects the brain. This disease predominantly affects the elderly. Alzheimer is the most common form of dementia.",
    "MedicalCondition": "Alzheimer’s disease does not usually begin before the age of 65 and affects more often women. A number of genes are known to reduce or increase the chances of a person to develop Alzheimer’s. Medical conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, stroke, and diabetes in mid-life can increase the risk of both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. It is also important to treat depression early. A healthy lifestyle such as regular physical exercise, healthy balanced diet with a healthy weight, moderate drinking and not smoking can reduce the risk of developing the condition. Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition. This means that, over time, more parts of the brain are impaired and this leads to more symptoms that develop. These symptoms that are mild at the beginning can become more severe and interfere with daily life. Some symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are common but one has to keep in mind that everyone is unique. The condition will not be experienced exactly in the same way by two distinct people. For most patients, memory gaps are the first symptoms experienced. The affected person will commonly lose everyday items such as glasses and keys somewhere in the house or be unable to learn new information and remember recent events or conversations. He will have difficulties to find the suitable word, lose track of the date or day or become confused. Many people lose interest in hobbies and activities and become withdrawn. As the disease progresses, the patient is no longer able to carry out such everyday tasks as physical hygiene, getting dressed, or eating and drinking. Additionally, hallucinations, becoming easily irritated, Parkinson’s symptoms, or depression may accompany the disease. The disease can be especially tragic for friends and family who suddenly are no longer recognized by the patient as such.",

    "TreatmentDescription": "Unfortunately there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s yet that can cure it completely. There are medications that can alleviate some of the symptoms and allow the Alzheimer’s patient to remain independent and part of their surroundings for longer. It is beneficial for a person with Alzheimer’s to keep up with activities that they enjoy such as reading or solving puzzles, attending sessions that stimulate their minds and help with wellbeing, mood and memory."

    "MedicalCondition": "An ankle injury occurs when the joint of the ankle is contorted too far out of its regular position. The condition develops mostly during activities related to sports. However the condition can develop even while walking on an irregular surface since such areas force the ankle and the foot into a position that is not natural. Another factor that may lead to the condition is the unusual position of the ankle when a person with loose-fitting clogs, sandals or high-heeled shoes walks. Other factors likely to trigger an ankle injury include rotating the ankle, rolling or contorting the ankle, an abrupt impact including during a car collision, landing after a jump in an uncomfortable position, and falling or slipping. The symptoms of a rupture or fracture and of a twist are very alike and comprise the inability to carry weight or walk on the damaged joint, swelling, bruising, often sudden and sharp pain.

After six weeks, a stable ligament recovery can be assumed. If the ankle injury also causes a fracture of the lower leg bones, in most cases a surgery is necessary to stabilise with plates and screws. A long-term consequence, for example following a meniscus injury, is a higher risk of arthrosis."

The average age of those with the disease is between 65 and 70. Frequent contact with various chemical substances, smoking, frequent urinary tract infections, as well as radiation therapy can favour the development of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer generally originates in the cells lining the bladder (ureothelial carcinoma, also called transitional cell carcinoma). It may have a single point of origin (unifocal), but usually there are several foci (multifocal). There are multiple degrees of severity of bladder cancer depending on how advanced tumor growth is, which structures in the bladder wall are affected, and even if other surrounding organs are affected. Treatment depends on the severity of the cancer.",

Sometimes it’s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination).

There are several types of melanoma: 1) Superficial spreading melanoma: the melanoma has flat but irregular shapes and different colors. 2) Nodular melanoma: the melanoma is not flat but raised. The raised areas are normally black and dark blue or red. This form is especially malignant because it tends to spread into the depth of the skin, which makes metastases more likely. 3) Lentigo maligna melanoma: the melanoma rises on base of a lentigo maligna. This skin alteration often appears due to over-exposure to sunlight, especially on the face, neck and arms. 4) Acral lentiginous melanoma: the melanoma often appears on nails, palms, soles and mucosa. 5.) Amelanotic melanoma: a nodular melanoma without dark pigmentation. Possible indications of melanoma based on the acronym ABCDE include 1) Asymmetry: it often is unevenly shaped, 2) Borders: the edges are irregular, 3) Color: the melanoma has different colors (very dark and brighter areas in the same lesion), 4) Diameter: the melanoma is usually larger than 5mm in diameter, 5) Evolution: it may change in appearance, either in size or color.",

To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination).

    "MedicalCondition": "Accident-related bone fractures are a common consequence of car crashes or other unexpected accidents, which cause extreme force to be exerted on the bones. Serious broken bones injuries include pelvic fractures, fractures to the sternum or ribs, spine and skull fractures. A fracture of the forearm (Radius) is most frequently. Other common types of broken bone injuries include fractures of the ankle, femur, collarbone, and hand. Forms of fractures vary; in general they include 1) buckle or greenstick fracture (an incomplete fracture with intact periosteum on one side, which only occurs in children), 2) hairline/stress fracture, 3) rotation fracture, 4) avulsion fracture, 5) oblique fracture, 6) comminuted fracture and 7) compound fracture.",
    "Name": "Accident-related bone fracture of hand",
    "PossibleSymptoms": "Blue spot on skin,Bone fracture,Finger deformity,Hand pain,Hand swelling,Immobilization,Joint pain,Joint swelling,Limited mobility of the fingers,Pain in the bones",
    "ProfName": "Bone trauma of hand",
    "Synonyms": "Accident-related bone fracture",
    "TreatmentDescription": "Treatment of accident-related fractures often requires surgery as the injuries often include multiple fractures or crush injuries and a high blood loss. Due to this, reconstructive surgery may be required. Most important is reconstruction of length, axis and rotation of the bone. Depending on what bones were broken, recovery could take a substantial amount of time, and rehabilitation may also be needed. Besides surgery, medication such as antibiotics (in open fractures) and analgesics can be considered for relieving pain or prevent bacterial infections."
