      "Description": "Flu is a disease of the human's respiratory system. It is highly contagious and spreads usually by the sneezes and coughs of an infected person. People can also catch a flu by shaking hands of an infected person. Adults are contagious one to two days before getting symptoms and up to seven days after becoming sick. This means that people can spread the virus before they even know that they are infected. More than 200'000 people are hospitalized every year due to complications from a flu and thousands die every year as a result of it. A flu epidemic can last numerous weeks in a country.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Flu (often referred as influenza), is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, throat, and respiratory tract by an influenza or parainfluenza virus. It’s seasonal, often occurring in winter, and can spread rapidly, called then flu epidemic. Swine flu and bird (avian) flu are specific strains of flu.",
      "MedicalCondition": "When the infection occurs in healthy young people, it is usually not dangerous and lasts around one or two weeks. In some cases a dry cough may develop and last a bit longer. Elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses have a higher risk for complications. For this reason it’s recommended that these groups get vaccinated. Swine and bird flus are caused by slight different influenza viruses, but causing similar symptoms. Flu typically develops rapidly, with fever (sometimes accompanied with chills), muscle pain, headache, a dry and painful cough, sore throat, and exhaustion or fatigue. It’s important to note that the flu is different from the common cold, which is often also caused by a virus, but causes milder symptoms.",

      "ProfName": "Influenza",
      "Synonyms": null,
      "TreatmentDescription": "Even today flu can have fatal consequences for those with pre-existing conditions and requires a hospital stay with emergency medical measures. Normally it is self-limited and the body recovers by itself. A doctor may prescribe medication to help shorten the course of the flu if taken early. Bed rest and staying hydrated are usually sufficient. Medications such as Ibuprofen or Aspirin can lower a fever and relieve symptoms, but they will not shorten the course of the illness and should be used in children with caution. Flu vaccine is recommended for the following groups at risk:  nursing infants, people over 60, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women."

      "Description": "Atrial fibrillation is a temporary or lasting arrhythmia of the heart in which the atrial chambers of the heart can't pump optimally. This leads to heart chambers, which don’t fill enough and which caused the typical complaints.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Atrial fibrillation is a trouble of the heart’s normal rhythm, whereby the atrium (of the heart) isn't able to pump optimally. Patients may experience heart palpitations and shortness of breath or even temporarily loss of consciousness.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Atrial fibrillation may intermittently occur in healthy people and more often in patients with a known cardiac disorder. Atrial fibrillation often goes unnoticed in those with it. Still, palpitations, a racing heart, feelings of dizziness, shortness of breath, and even momentary unconsciousness may occur.",
      "Name": "Irregular heart rhythm in atria",

      "ProfName": "Atrial fibrillation",
      "Synonyms": "Irregular heart rhythm involving heart chambers",
      "TreatmentDescription": "Occasionally a blood clot may form in the atrium, and leave the atria leading to a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Therefore patients are treated with blood-thinning drugs (mostly Marcoumar or Sintrom). The further treatment aims to keep the heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute, so that the heart can pump effectively. This may be attempted with medication, a pacemaker or a so-called cardioversion."

      "Description": "Asthma is a common, persistent, and inflammatory disease of the lungs and its comorbidities can affect the whole respiratory tract. It can occur as difficulty in breathing or a decline in performance at school, work, or in sport. The respiratory tract of an asthma patient possesses abnormal characteristics, it drastically constricts and swells with inflammation as an excessive response to external agents (e.g. physical effort or allergies), as a result, the affected person do not receive enough air in the lungs.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Asthma is a disease of the lungs which constricts the respiratory tract and causes shortness of breath. The majority of asthma attacks are caused by allergies. Left untreated, asthma can lead to chronic lung damage.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Asthma can be caused by allergies or be independent from allergies. Those with asthma caused by allergies often have family members with allergies against pollen. During an asthma attack, patients suffer from intense shortness of breath with noticeably loud breathing and coughing. Heart palpitations may also occur.",
      "Name": "Inflammatory disease of the airways",
      "PossibleSymptoms": "Cough,Wheezing,Shortness of breath,Sputum,Fast, deepened breathing,Chest tightness,Eye redness,Night cough,Tiredness,Chest pain,Breathing-related pains,Agitation,Blue colored skin,Cough with sputum",

      "Synonyms": "Asthma",
      "TreatmentDescription": "In children with asthma there is a high chance that the disease diminishes over the years, but in adults this is not often the case. Left untreated, asthma can lead to lasting damage in the lungs and permanent shortness of breath. Treatment of asthma caused by allergies is a matter of treating the underlying allergy. Furthermore, asthma patients generally receive medication that opens up the respiratory tract and, if necessary, medication that reduces the inflammation in the respiratory tract."

      "Description": "Allergies occur when the body’s defense system, known as the immune system, triggers an undesirable, inflammatory reaction to a substance (i.e. harmless materials in the environment, known as allergens), which would generally cause no reaction when in contact with people without allergies. Having an allergy can affect a person's daily activities and be a nuisance. However, most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control.",
      "DescriptionShort": "An allergy is an undesired reaction to a substance which under normal circumstances do not cause any reaction in healthy people. Many substances can cause an allergy, e.g. pollen from trees and grasses, animal hair, dust mites, food, medications, and certain skin products.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Allergies against pollen from trees and grasses are commonly known as hay fever. It can manifest in the form of an inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), hay fever (rhinitis) or asthma and usually occurs in spring and summer. Dust mites and animal hair can also trigger allergies, which can also be identified through inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), chronic nasal discomfort (rhinitis) or asthma. These often manifest themselves throughout the year. Certain foods can also trigger allergic reactions, which can lead to either very mild symptoms (for example, a prickling sensation in the mouth and throat areas after enjoying certain fruits) or to life threatening reactions throughout the body. These need to be distinguished from intolerance reactions. Medications are yet another group of substances which can trigger allergies, usually involving the skin, but which can also affect internal organs. So ­called contact allergies are a group of skin diseases that result from skin contact with a substance and trigger an inflammatory reaction called eczema. People with a higher inherited (genetic) predisposition to developing allergies against pollen, animal hair, or food are called atopic. Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who are not allergic to them. Allergens can cause an itchy, red rash, sneezing, watery and itchy red eyes and a blocked or runny nose, which can worsen towards an eczema or asthma symptoms.",

      "ProfName": "Allergy",
      "Synonyms": "Hypersensitivity of the immune system",
      "TreatmentDescription": "In rare cases, an allergic reaction can become life threatening, a severe reaction named anaphylactic shock or anaphylaxis can occur. In such a case, the patient must have an emergency kit at his disposal so that he can use it himself (see the article on food allergies). The treatment of an allergy consists, when possible, of the avoidance of the substance that causes it. When the substance cannot be avoided, medical alleviation of the ailments becomes necessary, for example, with antihistamines. In certain cases, a specific kind of immunotherapy, also called desensitization, is indicated."

      "Description": "High blood pressure, also known as arterial hypertension, is the state of  constant high pressure in the blood vessels, specifically the arteries. According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.",
      "DescriptionShort": "High blood pressure is a chronic increase in the pressure in certain blood vessels, which can be dangerous, as it can lead to permanent damage of vital organs such as the brain, heart or eyes.",
      "MedicalCondition": "High blood pressure is common and usually goes unnoticed by the affected individual. For this reason, periodically having your blood pressure taken at a check-up by an expert (such as a doctor or nurse) is highly recommended. Uncomfortable symptoms such as early morning headaches, palpitations, dizziness, and ringing in the ears occur seldom.",

      "Description": "Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which the body’s release of the hormone insulin is either reduced or the effectiveness of the hormone is reduced. The pancreas is responsible for the constant production of insulin.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Diabetes is a disease in which the level of blood sugar remains high, which can lead to damage of the smaller blood vessels, which in turn can damage various organs such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Diabetes due to a reduced release of or total lack of insulin is referred to as Type-1 diabetes (formerly juvenile diabetes mellitus) and is actually an autoimmune disease. Here, the body’s defense system turns against the body itself. The resulting reduced efficiency of the insulin is referred to as Type-2 diabetes (formerly called adult onset diabetes).",

      "ProfName": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "Synonyms": null,
      "TreatmentDescription": "It’s important to note that blood sugar levels that remain high lead to damage in small blood vessels in various organs including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves that contribute to tactile sensation. This damage of the vessels leads to damage in these organs. Injury to nerves in the hands and feet is often referred to as polyneuropathy. The treatment of diabetes is carried out through regularly checking blood sugar levels and through medication. When it comes to medication, either insulin shots are administered or in the case of Type-2 diabetes it may be enough to take medications that strengthen the effect of insulin or insulin production. Regular and consistent testing of your average blood sugar levels over a period of 3 months with an HbA1c test by your doctor is important, as well as regular eye examinations by your ophthalmologist."

      "Description": "Reflux disease is very common worldwide. It is usually due to a backflow of stomach acid through a weakened esophagus. If this occurs regularly, it will develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease, a burning of the mucous membrane in the esophagus.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease is often referred to as gastric or acid reflux disease, as this is the most common complaint. The cause of this symptom is a backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which then causes a burning sensation (hence the name).",
      "MedicalCondition": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs in about 20% of the population in industrial countries. The main symptom is a dull burning, or feelings of pain or pressure in the throat and chest areas, which is where it gets the common name heartburn. It frequently occurs when lying down (at night for example), after copious eating, or after consumption of alcohol and can become noticeable as a chronic cough.",

      "Synonyms": "GERD",
      "TreatmentDescription": "In certain cases, damage to the mucous membrane in the throat can become permanent (Barrett’s esophagus) which requires regular check-ups with a specialist, since this damage can degenerate. For people suffering from this, it’s recommended that they maintain a low-fat diet, avoid eating meals late at night, quit smoking and using alcohol, and in the case of overweight patients a reduction in weight it recommended. Medications that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, for example) have been shown to be effective, but they do not treat the cause of the reflux of acid. Furthermore, a test to discover if a stomach infection of Helicobacter pylori is at play may be appropriate, since this can cause or intensify heartburn. In most cases this can be cured with a treatment of antibiotics."

      "Description": "Tobacco consumption is among the main causes for diseases and death around the world. However related diseases and death can be prevented. Tobacco consumption causes numerous different cancers and chronic diseases affecting the life length such as bronchitis and emphysema. Tobacco use causes also heart diseases, issues related to pregnancy, affects negatively the respiratory system, and causes numerous other severe health issues. Even people who don’t smoke are in danger when they are around smokers. A study reported that nonsmokers increase considerably their risk to have lung cancer and heart disease when they are around people who are smoking.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Smoking affects many organs of the body negatively, including important ones such as the lungs, heart, and brain. It’s been shown that tobacco consumption damages these organs, especially the lungs, but also the mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, and nose as well as negatively affects the blood circulation, and with that the heart and the brain. Smokers can consequently suffer from lung cancer, heart attacks, or strokes. Smokers die on average 13-14 years earlier than non-smokers.",
      "MedicalCondition": "As a consequence of using tobacco products, smokers have a higher chance of developing cancer (usually lung cancer), of having a (fatal) heart attack, suffering from a stroke, and developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because lung cancer (see: lung carcinoma) often does not cause any complaints until late, it is often discovered at a stage, where the disease can no longer be cured. Damage to the organs is caused by various highly poisonous substances that are found in tobacco smoke. Smoking not only does the smoker harm, but also people in their surroundings due to passive smoking. It should be noted that even tobacco smoke that is passively inhaled contains poisonous substances that are even more concentrated than smoke that passes through a filter. It is extremely dangerous for nursing babies and small children.",

This condition is characterized by an increase in impulsive motility or contractions of muscles located in the large and small intestines. Such contraction or motility is known as spasm and connected to irritable bowel syndrome. However, the condition can also be connected to a decrease in motility. This makes the name spastic colon less accurate. The severity and cause of the condition is not always the same among patients.

      "Description": "Suspicious skin lesions are most commonly mentioned in relation to a suspected skin cancer. Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.",

Changes to the skin, especially suspicious ones should be examined by a doctor – ideally by a dermatologist.",
      "MedicalCondition": "A suspicious change of the skin might be caused by an infection in or on the skin such as a wart. The virus of a wart is transmitted through skin contact. Shingles or chickenpox that happens throughout the body can also trigger suspicious changes of skin. Birthmarks are changes of skin that are usually present since birth. Some suspicious changes can follow a sensitivity or an allergic response triggered by conditions such as diabetes or poor circulation. Autoimmune illnesses like psoriasis can also trigger changes on the skin. Most cancers are detected through obvious signs such as sickness, pain, tenderness, bumps or lumps. However, it is difficult to identify a change of skin since the change is not often obvious. The detection of a suspicious change of skin is tricky because usually this change happens gradually and without clear signs. However, it is recommended to use always a thumb to feel for any change while making the difference between normal and unusual detail. A person should pay attention to lesions, moles, and spots present on the body in order to compare it with details that seem different. Other suspicious signs include changes happening on a mole such as bleeding, oozing or the presence of a nodule or bump, pain, tenderness or itchiness. Further signs that should be considered as a warning are a new engorgement beyond the limit, redness or a tenderness that is hard to heal. A pigment that spreads from its boundary into the skin all around should be taken as a warning sign as well.",

Tinnitus is often brief and severe (acute). When it occurs for a long duration of time it is referred to as chronic tinnitus.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) is a disturbing noise perceived by the affected person, but not by others. It means hearing sounds that are originating not from outside but from inside the body. The condition is described often by a ringing sound even if the patient can hear several sounds including whistling, hissing, humming, grinding, and buzzing. Some patients can have pulsatile tinnitus when the noises they hear beat in rhythm with their pulse. Other people can hear noises similar to singing or music.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Tinnitus is very common. It can emerge as a result of loud noise (music, artillery fire), certain medications, hearing loss in the elderly, problems with the jaw’s temporomandibular joint, or because of overwhelming stress. Those with tinnitus perceive a disturbing, whistling or humming noise in their ears. In many cases, troubles to sleep, weakness of concentration, and partial impairment of hearing may also occur and compromise quality of life.",

      "TreatmentDescription": "Tinnitus is rarely caused by a tumor of the acoustic nerve or vascular problems, which can be resolved by operation. For this reason it’s recommended that you see a specialist for clarification. In the case of a short-term occurrence it’s recommended that you keep calm and wait until the next morning. If it is still present in the morning, make an appointment with your doctor, and if necessary, seek treatment. Quiet and relaxation are generally beneficial. Medication is an option.  Cortisone and substances that promote blood circulation can achieve an alleviation of complaints. Treatment could be difficult and may not cure tinnitus."

      "Description": "The inflammation of the middle ear, which lies between the external auditory canal and the inner ear, is called otitis media. Anyone can experience otitis media but the condition is most common in children between six and fifteen months old. According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.",

The inflammation is typically experienced as an (pulsating) earache and fever and usually heals on its own within a week.  This type of inflammation is different from long term (chronic) middle ear infections that affect either the mucus membranes or the bones of the middle ear (a disease called cholesteatoma) which generally leads to lasting damage of the eardrum.",

      "Description": "In otitis externa, the inflammation is limited to the outside of the ear channel and does not spread beyond the eardrum. The condition is called often ‘swimmer’s ear’ since frequent contact to water can cause the ear tunnel to be more exposed to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa can improve within a few days with treatment and such short otitis externa is referred as ‘acute’ but some otitis externa can last for numerous months or maybe for longer and are referred as ‘chronic’.",

The earwax will then be removed from the ear canal. There are various ways to remove it, such as suction, rinsing with warm water or usage of hydrogen peroxide. To prevent the build-up of earwax into an impaction it’s suggested to avoid cleaning the ears with cotton swabs, but to rinse it regularly. This is preferred to be done by a doctor, because the eardrum and middle ear may become damaged if removal is not professionally executed."

It can either develop as a common sinus infection (rhinitis, a cold) or less commonly in conjunction with allergies. If sinusitis lasts longer than two months, it is referred to as being chronic. The maxillary sinus is often affected as well in acute or chronic infections. Because of the swelling of the mucosa in the paranasal sinuses, its secretions can no longer flow out properly and they become lodged in the paranasal sinuses.

Some mineral and vitamin deficiencies, blood diseases, trauma, Crohn’s disease, and allergies cause similar ulcers. Aphthous stomatitis sores are confused often with cold sores that are caused by a herpes virus. According to its size and further characteristics, aphthous stomatitis can be classified into three types. First of all, if the sore is smaller than one centimeter, then it is called minor aphthous stomatitis. Second, if the sore is bigger than one centimeter, then it is called major aphthous stomatitis. The major type also includes more than one lesion at the time, longer duration than 10 days and eventually even scars after healing. Third, if the sores are extremely small but somehow they merge together, then it is called herpetiform aphthous stomatitis, this name is due to its similar look to a herpes simplex virus infection. People with aphthous stomatitis will feel pain or tingling inside their mouth, which may cause a difficulty to speak normally or to eat. The affected person may feel a tingling or burning sensation in an inflammed area right before the appearance of the ulcer. In order to form fully, an ulcer takes 2 to 3 days. The sores are symmetric, shallow and round. This means that the sores are the same on all sides and are painful. The painful phase lasts three to ten days.

This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.",

A low body weight can lead to hormonal disorders, such as irregularity or absence of menstruation. Men with anorexia may experience loss of potency and sexual drive. When the body fails to receive sufficient nutrition, bones can no longer rebuild themselves, which can lead to the early development of chronic osteoporosis. In rare cases it can lead to a reduced heart rate and body temperature, which requires an urgent trip to the hospital. Treatment of anorexia requires a specialist and is extremely important, as undernourishment can be fatal under certain circumstances. Treatment often occurs over a long period of time and relapse is common. In the event of acute life-threatening weight loss, induced nutrition, e.g. via a gastric tube or high-calorie drinks will be the initial treatment, followed by intensive psychotherapy and nutritional counselling."

Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.",

Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, it’s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately. Additionally, a class of medications called bisphosphonates may be used to stop further bone loss.

It overwhelmingly affects women of childbearing age, as loss of iron occurs during menstruation or the intestines fail to absorb enough of it. Men can also have an iron deficiency and upon further investigation it is usually discovered that there is an issue of iron absorption or bleeding somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Besides an iron deficiency, a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folic acid can also be a cause of anemia. Genetic diseases that can cause anemia, such as thalassemia are rare.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in countries with less sunshine, since natural vitamin D can only be formed when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Since the population don’t get enough sunlight during the year length and protect often from sun exposure with sun lotion during summer time, the bodies are not able to produce this necessary vitamin. It’s possible to get some vitamin D through dietary supplements, such as cod liver, salmon, chicken eggs, and beef liver, but the amount of vitamin that these sources provide is not sufficient.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Vitamin D deficiency is a regular condition. Vitamin D plays vital roles for numerous functions within the body including reducing inflammation, promoting cell and bone growth, keeping normal levels of phosphate and calcium, and promoting the absorption of calcium. For these reasons a lack of Vitamin D can commonly lead to osteomalacia in adults or rickets in children.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Numerous factors can lead to lack of vitamin D. A firm vegan regime for a long period can deprive the body from the sufficient amount of vitamin D since animals are the natural providers of this vitamin. A limited exposure to the light from sun can also lead to vitamin D deficiency since the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to its light. A limited exposure to the light from the sun can happen when a person puts on long dresses or covers themselves for religious motives, or have activities that keep them away from the sun. People with dark skin are also at risk of vitamin D deficiency since the ability of the skin to produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight is reduced by the pigment melanin. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused also by the inability of the kidney to convert this vitamin to its active type. This can happen in case of disease or ageing process. This deficiency can also be caused by the inability of the digestive tract to absorb adequately vitamin D. This can be the result of some medical issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic disease that affect the ability of the intestine to absorb the vitamin from the food eaten. Obesity can also cause vitamin D deficiency as fat cells extract the vitamin from the blood, fluctuating its discharge into the circulation. Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include muscle weakness and bone pain. However, many people have subtle symptoms. Yet, deficiency of vitamin D can expose the body to health risks such as cardiovascular disease, severe asthma, cancer, and cognitive impairment. A vitamin D deficiency in children can lead to rickets, a condition in which bone development is arrested. Adults can suffer from osteomalacia.",

It has been shown that muscle power increases based on that and that the bone loss (osteoporosis) can be positively influenced as well as the frequency of falls can be reduced. As the diseases related to a deficiency of vitamin D can be critical it is important for a potentially affected person to find a suitable therapy with help of a medical doctor in order to reach the necessary level of vitamin D."

      "Description": "Patients with myopia are suffering from a defective vision, where far away objects cannot be perceived in focus. The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Myopia, known also as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is a condition that occurs when the light concentrates in front of the eye, rather on the retina. Patients perceive objects located far away to be unfocused and blurry, whereas nearby objects located close are seen sharply and normally. Lots of people suffer from shortsightedness.",
      "MedicalCondition": "In case of myopia, the ball of the eye is relatively too long to concentrate the power of the lens and cornea of the eye. This causes rays of the light to come together not directly on the surface of the retina, but at a spot in front of it. The condition occurs also when the lens or cornea is too bent for the length or size of the eyeball. Myopia happens also in some cases when these two factors are combined. The condition starts typically in childhood and people with parents suffering from myopia are more likely to develop the condition. In most cases, myopia stabilizes at the beginning of adulthood but can progress sometimes with age. People with shortsightedness find it hard to see clearly distant objects and read correctly road signs. However, these people can read easily close writings and use computer. Other symptoms and signs of short-sightedness include headaches, squinting, and eye strain. When the condition is not corrected, the person can feel tired when playing sports or driving.

      "Description": "Inside of the eye is the retina, in which optical perception takes place. In order for observed objects to be imaged correctly on the retina, the light that enters the eye needs to be refracted exactly on the surface of the retina. This refraction is achieved with help from the lens, which controls how much the light from an object is refracted depending on its distance. If this refraction is too weak or if the eyeball is too short, objects nearby may not be perceived clearly.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Farsightedness or hyperopia is a vision condition in which the patient can see distant objects clearly but cannot focus properly to close ones. The patient perceives objects that are closer as blurry. Hyperopia occurs when the cornea has too little curvature or the eyeball is too short, making it hard for the eye to focus the light correctly which penetrates it.",

Patients notice that the closer an observed object is to the eye, the blurrier it seems to be. One of the causes of farsightedness is a flat cornea. Further causes can be a short eyeball which is shorter than normal, that can cause the light to concentrate behind the eye's retina rather than on it. Family history is also among the causes of farsightedness. The condition develops often in adults as the lenses of the eyes age. It is difficult for people with farsightedness to see anything up close. They have to work hard in order to see close things and this causes strain in the eyes. This extra strain causes some symptoms of farsightedness. The symptoms include blurry vision up close, fatigue, tension, squinting in order to see better, a burning or aching sensation around the eyes, and a headache after tasks such as reading that require to concentrate on something up close.

This is hard for aging eyes that require glasses for close-up tasks including sewing or reading. The condition can be corrected in the simplest way by getting prescription contact lenses or eyeglasses with converging lenses (“plus” lenses). Such lenses or eyeglasses are corrective as they change the way light enters the eyes and compensating the insufficient refractive power of the lens, helping the patient to concentrate better.

Common triggers for contact dermatitis include fragrances in cosmetics, perfumes, lotions, shampoos, soaps, citrus fruit, particularly the peel, latex rubber, chemicals used in tanning leather, nickel found in belt buckles and jewelry, hair dyes or straighteners, poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy as well as certain medicine applied on the skin. The skin of the affected person can form blisters or it can form a raised red area with rash. This means that the skin will itch and probably show a burning feeling. Whenever something is damaging or irritating the skin, the affected person can immediately see the rash. However the rash can take one to two days to appear if its underlying cause is an allergy.

To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination).

Conservative treatments include support stocking of compression class II, alternatively the legs can be wrapped with short-stretch bandages or a zinc paste bandage. Long standing and sitting should be avoided for the benefit of lying and walking. Kneipp applications (hot/cold sequence showers) support the venous blood return, as well as the activation of the muscle pump, the active ankle movement, whereby the lower leg muscles work and basically “squeeze out” the veins. If an ulcer already exists, it needs to be cleaned and the dead tissue needs to be removed, followed by a frequent and lengthy treatment with wound dressings and compressions. When the ulcer doesn’t heal or gets infected again and again, surgical measures may be considered. A surgical treatment of varicose veins can be an option as well, depending on the stage and the affected areas.

During the seizure the patient may bite their tongue, urinate, or defecate. In contrast, an absence seizure presents as an acute disruption in awareness without a deeper loss of consciousness and usually occurs in children and youth. It can manifest as discreet signs such as blinking, slight twitching, or absent-mindedness. Absence seizures usually occur several times a day and can be triggered by quick breathing. Simple focal seizures involve muscle twitching that it limited to a specific area or sensations on the skin. Acoustic and visual sensitivity can also be symptoms of epilepsy. Patients often remain conscious. Complex focal seizures involve déjà vu phenomena, feeling of insubstantiality, hallucinations or even heart-racing and difficulty in breathing. The patient’s gaze becomes rigid, the patients perform chew- and lick-movements and produce retching sounds.",

However, there are several conditions that can cause the fertilized egg to implant somewhere else but not within the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy happens mostly in the oviduct. Ovary, cervix and abdominal cavity are other places where an ectopic pregnancy may occur. The most common cause is an obstruction (stenosis) of an oviduct, which can prevent the fertilized egg from entering the uterus. Such obstructions occur due to scar formation, typically after infections of the female reproductive system (adnexitis), but also after surgery and after a previous ectopic pregnancy in the oviduct. Another well-known cause is endometriosis, which can increase risks for ectopic pregnancy and other difficulties in pregnancy. The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can be abnormal vaginal bleeding, low back pain, mild cramping on one side of the pelvis and pain in the lower pelvic area. Often this condition will lead to an inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and its typical abdominal pain, which exacerbates on mild pressure of the abdomen and on physical activity.

Other causes may comprise arthritis, other syndromes or illnesses such as Marfan syndrome and cerebral palsy. Inappropriate shoes that do not fit correctly can contribute to the occurrence of the condition since tight shoes may rub against the big toe joint and high-heeled shoes may squeeze the feet, causing the big toe to be stuck in a leaned position. Such position keeps the big toe stretched. The nerve around the big toe will be pressured, triggering pain. In addition, high heels push most of the body weight forward onto the front part of the foot, which puts significant strain on the joints of the toe. The main symptom of the condition is the big toe directing in the way of the other toes present on the same foot. This may lead to the foot bone linked to the big toe to point outwards. Secondary symptoms may comprise sore skin above the upper part of the hallux valgus, red, callused and hard skin generated by the overlapping of the great toe and the following toe, swelling and pain on the joint of the great toe. Changes to the form of the foot may make it hard to find appropriate shoes and wearing shoes may then trigger a pressure that makes the pain worse.

A misguided immune system will destroy the myelin sheath that surrounds and protects the nerve cells, and lead to focus of inflammation and later a scar on the affected nerve cells. This causes a variety of symptoms depending on the affected area in the central nervous system. Common symptoms are restrictions in movements, sensibility and sight.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that attacks the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells. Though it cannot be totally cured, treatments such as medication, physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy can help to control the symptoms and prevent fast progression of the disease.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. However, the causes may be related to genetic problems, viral infections or environmental factors. Once the autoimmune system starts to attack the myelin sheath, it will lead to a focus of inflammation and may leave scars on the affected areas. The inflammations can occur everywhere in the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (white matter) either in the brain or spinal cord. All Symptoms are the result of a nerve failure caused by a focus of inflammation and are therefore as various as the locations of these foci. An often seen but not necessary first symptom is the loss of sight on one eye due to an inflammation of the optical nerve (neuritis nervi optici). Multiple sclerosis may among others lead to symptoms such as abnormal movements, thoughts, and sensations. For example, people with MS often suffer from weakness of the muscles and show a handicap in movement such as abnormal walking patterns or inability to walk. Other symptoms are numbness, tingling sensations, coordination problems, imbalance, memory problems and changes in personality, fatigue, loss of bladder or bowel control.",

The three most common substances include: 1) Caustic substances: people may drink this type of substance accidentally or with suicidal purpose. Some of these substances are common in daily life, for example cleaners, acids, alkalis, and other strong chemicals. 2) Boiling fluids: very hot fluids can cause burning of the esophageal mucosa. 3) Pills: Some pills contain substances that are toxic for the mucosa. If such pills are stuck in the esophagus, they can also damage its tissues. Besides esophageal corrosion, there are some more reasons for an inflammation of the esophagus, such as radiation therapy, infections with viruses and fungi, and the most common is reflux of gastric acid (see also gastric reflux disease). People with esophageal inflammations often have symptoms such as pain during swallowing, difficulty in swallowing, esophageal stricture, loss of appetite and even bleeding.",

      "MedicalCondition": "The salivary glands produce saliva in the mouth. However, the salivary gland stones can form because there are many different components, such as mineral salts, in saliva, which can precipitate and subsequently form a hard, chalk-like mass and block the gland. When the salivary gland is blocked, it will cause the saliva to accumulate and then result in swelling of the gland, which can be painful. Furthermore, it may lead to inflammation, especially if the gland gets infected with bacteria. There are three different kinds of salivary glands: 1) parotid glands, 2) submandibular glands, and 3) sublingual glands. Salivary gland stones occur more often in the submandibular and parotid glands. Promoting factors for the development of salivary stones are dehydration, high blood level of calcium and inflammatory diseases of the salivary gland. People with salivary gland stones often have symptoms such as problems with opening the mouth or swallowing, dry mouth, pain in the mouth or face, and swelling of the neck or face.",

      "TreatmentDescription": "Normally people can drink more water to avoid getting salivary gland stones. Once salivary gland stones start to accumulate in the salivary gland, treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of these stones. The treatment may include 1) massaging the gland and attempting to manually move the stone out of the gland by pushing it out, 2) surgery in order to remove the salivary stones. Nowadays, this can be done with a minimally invasive endoscopy of the salivary gland, 3) use of shock wave lithotripsy. Shock waves are able to break the salivary stones. If the salivary gland becomes infected due to the obstruction, then medication such as antibiotics and surgery to drain or even remove the affected glands may be considered."

      "MedicalCondition": "The causes of a squint include: 1) damage or problems of the eye muscles, 2) damage or problems of the nerves which control the eye muscles, or 3) damage to an area of the brain which integrates the information to coordinate eye movement, caused, for example, by a stroke. 4) Poor sight on one eye that prevents the brain from getting an optical feedback about the actual position of the eye. In addition, a squint can also develop due to a congenital problem or general health conditions. People with a family history of a squint, refractive error such as farsightedness, and medical conditions such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, stroke and head injuries, may have a higher risk of developing a squint. A squint can be classified on basis of direction into four types: 1) inward turning: esotropia, 2) outward turning: exotropia, 3) upward turning: hypertropia, and 4) downward turning: hypotropia. Quite recently affected persons often suffer from double vision. After a while living with a squint, the patient’s brain will suppress the information of the affected eye and therefore the affected person will barely notice anything. For children between 1 and 3 years of age, a squint is actually a dangerous condition. In this timeframe the visual area matures and a squint could lead to an irreversible and lifelong suppression of one eye (amblyopia).",

Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.",

      "Description": "Heart failure is a syndrome that can be caused by various conditions. Eventually, the heart is weakened up to a point where it can’t pump enough blood through the systemic circulation (left heart failure) or the lungs (right heart failure). So therefore it doesn't mean that it has stopped working, instead the pumping of blood is weaker than normal. The disorders which lead to a heart failure cannot all completely be healed, however the right treatment plan can help to alleviate the symptoms and signs of a heart failure. This in turn can help the patient to live longer than it would be the case without a treatment. With heart failure, blood moves at a slower rate through the heart and body, triggering an increase of the pressure in the heart. The result is that the heart cannot pump enough nutrients and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Heart failure is the major cause of hospitalization in people older than age 65.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Heart failure, known sometimes as congestive heart failure, describes the result of a condition when the heart muscle cannot pump a sufficient amount of blood through the body. Some conditions, such as high blood pressure or narrowed arteries in the heart gradually lead the heart to become too stiff or weak to fill completely and pump efficiently.",
      "MedicalCondition": "A left heart failure causes difficulty in breathing and coughing, first during physical strain, eventually also in an idle state. If the condition progresses further, the patient might only be able to breathe properly while sitting down or with propped-up arms. Other symptoms of left heart failure are reduced performance, weakness and memory impairment. Symptoms of right heart failure include swollen ankles, weight gain and sometimes a painful liver enlargement. Both forms of heart failure cause the patient to feel the need to go to the toilet frequently at night and heart palpitations.",

      "MedicalCondition": "The cause of Gilbert’s disease is an abnormal gene inherited through both parents. It is autosomal-recessive, which means that both genes (paternal and maternal) need to be abnormal in order to cause the disease. People with a respective family history may have a higher risk of getting the disease. Affected persons are born with the disease but it is usually discovered accidentally. For example, Gilbert’s disease is usually found in a blood test which indicates an abnormal level of bilirubin. Gilbert’s disease affects the degradation of bilirubin, which is an intermediate product in the degradation process of hemoglobin. In combination with an increased formation of bilirubin, this inefficient metabolism will cause an accumulation of bilirubin in the body, and as a result, either the skin or the sclera may turn yellow. The yellow skin or sclera is called jaundice or icterus. Besides, people with Gilbert’s disease normally have no or only mild symptoms such as fatigue. The following conditions can increase the level of bilirubin: 1) any inflammatory and inflectional illness, 2) dehydration, 3) menstruation, 4) stress, 5) strenuous exercise, and 6) lack of sleep. Besides bilirubin, the reduced metabolism may also affect the degradation of certain medications.",

      "DescriptionShort": "Strain of the neck muscles happens when the neck muscle is over-stretched, -stressed or torn. It usually takes some weeks to heal. It is recommended to follow the principles of RICE (rest, icing, compression and elevation) when strain of the neck muscle happens and to avoid overusing the affected muscles. Medications like painkiller can also relieve the symptoms.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Strain of the neck muscles can be caused by: 1) Improper postures, such as being hunched over to read or to use a computer, 2) Improper position during sleep, such as sleeping on a pillow that is too high or too hard. In this situation, the neck has to stretch and maintain the same posture, and strain may happen. 3) Carrying or lifting heavy things on the shoulders, which can cause overstretch of the neck muscles. 4) Traumas and injuries, which can damage or over-stretch the neck muscles, such as a fall from a height, sport accident or a car accident. Due to the initial damage on the muscles, nerve fibers are irritated and via a reflex arc this leads to a further increased contraction of the muscle. This circuit is the reason why a strain of the neck muscles takes a longer time to heal than the often little damage would let expect.",

Meanwhile, pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, muscle relaxants can also help to relieve the symptoms and give a breakthrough in the vicious circle. Massage can help the blood flow to the neck muscle and loosen the tight muscles. Heat therapy can also achieve this purpose. Immediately after damaging the muscles it is recommended to cool the area to prevent inflammation. Afterwards warming is advantageous to increase blood flow and thereby accelerate healing. It may take a few weeks for the neck muscle to recover. During this time it is better to avoid too intensive activities, which lead to pain."

      "DescriptionShort": "Esophageal varices are abnormally enlarged veins in the lower part of the esophagus. This condition is often related to a liver disease. The varices reach into the esophageal lumen and are therefore vulnerable to injuries. This would cause massive bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, which necessitates immediate medical treatment.",
      "MedicalCondition": "Esophageal varices develop due to stowage of blood in the portal vein system (portal hypertension). Whenever the regular blood flow through the liver is prevented, the blood will seek a collateral circulation. The veins of the esophagus provide such a collateral circulation but, if overused, will enlarge and become esophageal varices. The underlying cause of portal hypertension, and therefore of esophageal varices, are mostly liver-related problems, for example, more than forty percent of people with esophageal varices have liver cirrhosis. Liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, infection of the liver and fatty liver can all end into cirrhosis. In addition, thrombosis of the portal vein is also a common reason. Thrombosis of the portal vein is a condition when there is a blood clot stuck in the portal vein and it thereby causes high pressure in the vein which then leads to esophageal varices. Generally speaking, all persons with hypertension of the portal vein, disregarded which cause it has, are at a high risk of getting the disease. People with esophageal varices mostly have mild symptoms such as abdominal pain or dysphagia. Guiding findings are other stigmas of portal hypertension such as ascites, specific skin marks and an enlargement of the spleen.

      "Description": "A jaw fracture is usually the condition of broken bones in the lower jaw (mandible, mandibular bones) or sometimes in the upper jaw (maxilla, facial bones). The fracture of the mandible is among the most common fractures because the anatomic location of the mandible is prominent and for this reason can be hit first. Various blunt shocks to the jaw such as direct assault used to be frequent causes of a mandibular fracture before common usage of automobiles. Nowadays, automobile accidents are often the cause of a mandibular fracture. Most of the time, just the nose is damaged. A mandibular fracture is a frequent facial injury resulting from a direct blow to the jaw. This fracture means that the joint that connects the jaw to the skull is dislocated. Sometimes, the jawbone is not fractured but symptoms may appear similar to the fracture of the jawbone.",

Congenital diseases of the heart valves often occur in the pulmonary valve and aortic valve, and acquired diseases of the heart valves often involve the aortic valve and mitral valve. Generally speaking, there are three common types of dysfunction of a heart valve: regurgitation, atresia and stenosis. Regurgitation occurs when the valves are unable to close adequately, and this leads to a flowing back of blood on every heartbeat. Stenosis means that the valves do not open regularly and therefore narrow the blood canal. This occurs when the valves thicken and become stiffer. Atresia means, that the channel where the valves are located is abnormally narrow and prevents blood flowing through.

      "Description": "Pelvic bones include the bones of hip, coccyx and sacrum. And a pelvic fracture is a disruption happening to any of these pelvic bones. The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.",
      "DescriptionShort": "A pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structures, which happens in the pelvis. However, pelvic fractures can be caused by many reasons, but most pelvic fractures result from high-energy forces such as a motorbike accident or fall from a height. An immediate medical treatment is necessary when pelvic fractures happen.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The causes of pelvic fractures include: 1) Avulsion fracture: these fractures usually occur when there is a sudden muscle contraction happening. Some pieces of pelvic bones will be torn away by the contractions of muscles. 2) Osteoporosis: elder people with osteoporosis have higher risks of getting pelvic fractures. Osteoporosis can result in the fractures because of the weakened bony structure. However, it will not damage the whole structure of the pelvic ring, but certain weak parts of the pelvic bones. 3) High-energy forces: this is the most common reason of getting pelvic fractures. For example, car accidents, a sudden high-energy force or fall from a height. The type of pelvic fracture can be very dangerous. It is very important to seek a medical treatment immediately. The common symptoms include pain, swelling and bruise of the pelvis.",

      "TreatmentDescription": "The treatments of pelvic fractures depend on the causes and the severity of the damage determines the care for a pelvic fracture. Fractures from low energy can be handled often with conservative treatment. The avulsion fracture may heal spontaneously, but the patient will need to use a walker to avoid too much stress on the pelvis. For some severe pelvic fractures caused by high energy  impact, such as fractures caused by accidents, a surgery is usually necessary because this kind of fracture often is accompanied by extensive bleeding and surgery will also be needed in order to rebuild the pelvis with the objective to restore stability that will enable the patients to restart their regular activities. Besides, medication such as pain reliever can help to relieve the discomforts."

More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence.

      "Description": "The condition \"tourette's syndrome\" was named after the revolutionary French neurologist, Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who was the first to describe the disorder in 1885. The initial symptoms of the condition are noticed typically in childhood, between three and nine years old. Gilles de la Tourette syndrome can happen in all people, no matter their ethnic groups. Men are affected more than women. In many cases, the patient shows less or symptoms of milder complexity like vocal tics or chronic motoric disturbances. Even if the disorder can be chronic with symptoms present during the entire life, the tic symptoms become worst for most patients in the beginning of their teen years. The symptoms improve at the end of their teen years but continue into their adulthood.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Tourette’s syndrome is a neuro-psychological disorder that results from a faulty development of the central nervous system. People with the syndrome suffer from so called tics, which are unwanted repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). The syndrome usually starts from childhood. It is recommended to visit a neurologist if there is any related symptom.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The exact cause of Tourette’s syndrome is somehow not clear at the moment. However, it is thought to be associated with a genetic problem that leads to an undesirable development of the motoric regulatory system in the brain. This genetic problem, which promotes the occurrence of tic disorders, can be inherited. As a result, there are aberrations in the brain of affected people leading to an overstimulation of motoric regulatory loops with the neurotransmitter dopamine, which then results in the execution of improper behaviors. Generally speaking, Tourette’s syndrome often starts from childhood, and happens to males more often than females. People with the syndrome will perform some repetitive and uncontrolled movements and sounds, which are called motor tics and vocal tics in medical terms. Blurting out some rude words or gestures unintentionally is just one of many forms of complex tics, which affects about 30% of the patients.",

      "TreatmentDescription": "Tourette’s syndrome can neither be cured nor treated causatively. However, medication can still help to control the tic disorders. Frequently prescribed medications are psychiatric drugs such as neuroleptics, anticonvulsants or antidepressants, which all influence the neurotransmitters and therefore help to improve the symptoms. Besides medications, behavioral therapy and psychotherapy may help patients to live with the disease and to learn techniques to suppress their tics."

      "MedicalCondition": "The causes of astigmatism are mainly an irregular shape of the cornea or an abnormal curvature of the lens. Once the shape of the cornea or the lens becomes irregular, the light cannot be bundled in a single point and will therefore not focus properly on the retinal. As a result, it will lead to a blurred vision at any distance. Astigmatism can be either congenital or acquired. A congenital astigmatism is present from birth, and often comes together with other problems in the optic system such as farsightedness or nearsightedness.

A customized pair of glasses or individually adapted lenses can compensate the irregularities in the optic system and help to adjust the light to focus properly on the retina. Nearsightedness or farsightedness can be adjusted at the same time. Up to a certain degree of severity, these adjustments can also be achieved with eye laser surgery. In this case the shape of the cornea will be modified in order to compensate for the refraction error. After all, make sure to discuss the possibilities of treatment with an oculist."

This inflow can stop the heart from  pumping blood effectively to other parts of the body. This causes fatigue and makes a person to have a short breath. The condition can develop over decades or suddenly. Once the condition becomes serious, surgery is often  needed to replace or repair the aortic valve.",
      "DescriptionShort": "Aortic regurgitation describes a condition when the aortic valve cannot close sufficiently and blood is able to flow back from the aorta into the left heart ventricle. It is mostly caused by a dysfunction of the aortic valve and rarely by an abnormality of the aorta. Minor asymptomatic forms do not need any treatment. More severe forms can be treated with medications or surgery.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The causes of aortic regurgitation include valvular dysfunctions and abnormalities of the ascending aorta. 1) Valvular dysfunction: congenital valvular disorders such as a bicuspid aortic valve cause more frequently valvular dysfunctions. But acquired causes like rheumatic fever, endocarditis, degenerative aortic valve diseases (aortic sclerosis), trauma and surgery are the most common causes of valvular dysfunctions and aortic regurgitation. 2) Aorta abnormalities: expansion of the aorta may also lead to an insufficient closure of the aortic valves and cause reverse blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. Therefore an aortic sclerosis, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a dissection of the aorta may also result in aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur either acute or chronic. Acute aortic regurgitation can manifest with the sudden appearance of significant symptoms such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and heart failure. Chronic aortic regurgitation normally happens gradually and can lead to an enlargement of the heart and end in a heart failure. The symptoms of chronic aortic regurgitation are gradually increasing shortness of breath, palpitations, pressure on the chest and loss of physical resilience.",

      "Description": "The esophagus is a long and hollow tube that connects the throat and stomach together, and its function is to transport food into the stomach. The esophagus is made of smooth muscles, which transport the food with peristaltic waves, and an upper and lower sphincter, which close the end of the esophagus if necessary. A dysfunction of the esophagus results from either abnormal muscular contractions of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal function of the upper or lower sphincter.",
      "DescriptionShort": "A dysfunction of the esophagus describes several conditions in which the esophagus cannot function normally. For example, gastroesophageal reflux is one of the common results of a dysfunction of the esophagus. It is recommended to visit a gastroenterologist for a further check if there are any related symptoms.",
      "MedicalCondition": "The causes of a dysfunction of the esophagus could either be an abnormal contraction of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal functioning of the upper or lower sphincter. 1) Dysfunction of the upper parts of the esophagus often results from an excessive muscular contraction of the esophagus (esophagus spasm), which leads to difficulty in swallowing and drinking. Typical symptoms of esophageal spasm are globus sensation in the throat, pain in the chest and regurgitation of food. 2) Dysfunctions of the lower esophagus can result from either a high or a low muscular contraction of the esophagus and its lower sphincter. If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too strong, while the peristaltic smooth muscle waves are too weak, it will prevent the food from passing into the stomach, so it gets stuck in the esophagus (achalasia). Typical symptoms are problems with swallowing, pain in the chest and upper abdomen and regurgitation of food. 3.) If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too weak, it may lead to a flow back of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus, which causes damage on the esophageal mucosa. This is a common problem that is referred to as gastroesophageal reflux. People with gastroesophageal reflux may have symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, painful swallowing or coughing at night. The typical symptom of heartburn means a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or the chest, which worsens after eating and at night while lying horizontally.",

But also less disastrous situations, like problems in the job or family, can lead to distress, when there is no compensation for stress or when a person feels helpless and does not know a way to handle with it. When a stress response is triggered, a series of changes will occur within the human body. For example: 1) a rise in pulse rate, 2) redirection of blood away from the extremities and to the major organs, and 3) release of cortisone, adrenalin and noradrenalin, which may cause physical and mental short and long term changes.

      "MedicalCondition": "There are 5 main types of cardiomyopathy. A dilative cardiomyopathy (“sacculation“ and enlargement of the heart, so that lesser amounts of blood are being pumped into the body circulation) occurs due to genetic factors, as part of circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease) and heart attack, following virus infections. Patients suffer from breathlessness, cardiac arrhythmia and general symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leads to a thickening musculature mainly of the left heart, without gaining any strength. On the contrary, muscle strength rather decreases! The result is a decrease in the amount of blood being pumped into the body circulation, due to the reduced muscle strength (non-obstructive type) or due to movements/tightening of the blood’s path (obstructive type). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also shows symptoms such as breathlessness under strain, cardiac arrhythmia and the general symptoms mentioned above. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very stiff. It can’t be filled with the sufficient amount of blood anymore, and the blood accumulates in front of the heart. This also leads to breathlessness, but also to an enlarged liver and spleen and may cause dysfunctions. Patients also suffer from swollen and heavy legs. The fourth type is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. When suffering from this type, heart muscle tissue is being more and more replaced by fatty and connective tissue. This tissue is less durable and tends to sag out, similar to the dilative cardiomyopathy. Fatty and connective tissue also doesn’t have the functions of muscle tissue and can’t contract to pump blood into the circulation. Patients suffer from short periods of unconsciousness, irregular heartbeat and heart palpitations. The fifth type is non-classifiable cardiomyopathies. All types can lead to sudden cardiac death.",

All measures include omission of substances or habits that can damage the heart (alcohol, smoking, certain medication), as well as rest. Cardiac insufficiency will be treated as well, but with different approaches. Additional specific measures are necessary for the respective types. This may include therapy of the underlying cause, pacemaker implantation, surgeries or even a heart transplant. The doctor will discuss the individual therapy with the patient.

The average age of those with the disease is between 65 and 70. Frequent contact with various chemical substances, smoking, frequent urinary tract infections, as well as radiation therapy can favour the development of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer generally originates in the cells lining the bladder (ureothelial carcinoma, also called transitional cell carcinoma). It may have a single point of origin (unifocal), but usually there are several foci (multifocal). There are multiple degrees of severity of bladder cancer depending on how advanced tumor growth is, which structures in the bladder wall are affected, and even if other surrounding organs are affected. Treatment depends on the severity of the cancer.",

Sometimes it’s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination). The decision must be made on an individual basis for each patient. Discussing options with your doctor is highly recommended."

Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.",
