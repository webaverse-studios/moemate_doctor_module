        "Description": "Atrial fibrillation is a temporary or lasting arrhythmia of the heart in which the atrial chambers of the heart can't pump optimally. This leads to heart chambers, which don’t fill enough and which caused the typical complaints.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Atrial fibrillation is a trouble of the heart’s normal rhythm, whereby the atrium (of the heart) isn't able to pump optimally. Patients may experience heart palpitations and shortness of breath or even temporarily loss of consciousness.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Atrial fibrillation may intermittently occur in healthy people and more often in patients with a known cardiac disorder. Atrial fibrillation often goes unnoticed in those with it. Still, palpitations, a racing heart, feelings of dizziness, shortness of breath, and even momentary unconsciousness may occur.",
        "Name": "Irregular heart rhythm in atria",
        "PossibleSymptoms": "Palpitations,Blackening of vision,Unconsciousness, short,Frequent urination,Tiredness,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Anxiety,Irregular heartbeat,Feeling faint",
        "ProfName": "Atrial fibrillation",
        "Synonyms": "Irregular heart rhythm involving heart chambers",
        "TreatmentDescription": "Occasionally a blood clot may form in the atrium, and leave the atria leading to a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Therefore patients are treated with blood-thinning drugs (mostly Marcoumar or Sintrom). The further treatment aims to keep the heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute, so that the heart can pump effectively. This may be attempted with medication, a pacemaker or a so-called cardioversion."

        "Description": "Asthma is a common, persistent, and inflammatory disease of the lungs and its comorbidities can affect the whole respiratory tract. It can occur as difficulty in breathing or a decline in performance at school, work, or in sport. The respiratory tract of an asthma patient possesses abnormal characteristics, it drastically constricts and swells with inflammation as an excessive response to external agents (e.g. physical effort or allergies), as a result, the affected person do not receive enough air in the lungs.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Asthma is a disease of the lungs which constricts the respiratory tract and causes shortness of breath. The majority of asthma attacks are caused by allergies. Left untreated, asthma can lead to chronic lung damage.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Asthma can be caused by allergies or be independent from allergies. Those with asthma caused by allergies often have family members with allergies against pollen. During an asthma attack, patients suffer from intense shortness of breath with noticeably loud breathing and coughing. Heart palpitations may also occur.",

        "Description": "Allergies occur when the body’s defense system, known as the immune system, triggers an undesirable, inflammatory reaction to a substance (i.e. harmless materials in the environment, known as allergens), which would generally cause no reaction when in contact with people without allergies. Having an allergy can affect a person's daily activities and be a nuisance. However, most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control.",
        "DescriptionShort": "An allergy is an undesired reaction to a substance which under normal circumstances do not cause any reaction in healthy people. Many substances can cause an allergy, e.g. pollen from trees and grasses, animal hair, dust mites, food, medications, and certain skin products.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Allergies against pollen from trees and grasses are commonly known as hay fever. It can manifest in the form of an inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), hay fever (rhinitis) or asthma and usually occurs in spring and summer. Dust mites and animal hair can also trigger allergies, which can also be identified through inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), chronic nasal discomfort (rhinitis) or asthma. These often manifest themselves throughout the year. Certain foods can also trigger allergic reactions, which can lead to either very mild symptoms (for example, a prickling sensation in the mouth and throat areas after enjoying certain fruits) or to life threatening reactions throughout the body. These need to be distinguished from intolerance reactions. Medications are yet another group of substances which can trigger allergies, usually involving the skin, but which can also affect internal organs. So ­called contact allergies are a group of skin diseases that result from skin contact with a substance and trigger an inflammatory reaction called eczema. People with a higher inherited (genetic) predisposition to developing allergies against pollen, animal hair, or food are called atopic. Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who are not allergic to them. Allergens can cause an itchy, red rash, sneezing, watery and itchy red eyes and a blocked or runny nose, which can worsen towards an eczema or asthma symptoms.",

        "TreatmentDescription": "In rare cases, an allergic reaction can become life threatening, a severe reaction named anaphylactic shock or anaphylaxis can occur. In such a case, the patient must have an emergency kit at his disposal so that he can use it himself (see the article on food allergies). The treatment of an allergy consists, when possible, of the avoidance of the substance that causes it. When the substance cannot be avoided, medical alleviation of the ailments becomes necessary, for example, with antihistamines. In certain cases, a specific kind of immunotherapy, also called desensitization, is indicated."

        "Description": "In otitis externa, the inflammation is limited to the outside of the ear channel and does not spread beyond the eardrum. The condition is called often ‘swimmer’s ear’ since frequent contact to water can cause the ear tunnel to be more exposed to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa can improve within a few days with treatment and such short otitis externa is referred as ‘acute’ but some otitis externa can last for numerous months or maybe for longer and are referred as ‘chronic’.",
        "DescriptionShort": "The inflammation of the outer ear canal, also known as otitis externa, affects the ear canal and can sometimes attack the pinna (visible part of the ear). It manifests as strong ear aches, urge to itch inside the ear, as well as reddened, swollen, and sometimes crusted skin in the outer ear. The condition is caused usually by an infection. Sometimes, irritation or allergy can be the cause.",
        "MedicalCondition": "It is predominantly adults who are affected, especially those with injuries to the ear canal, or who have not cleaned the ear properly, or who suffer from diabetes or immuno-deficiencies. This kind of infection is noticeable due to intense earaches and the urge to itch inside the ear.

        "Description": "Sinusitis is an inflammation of one or more paranasal sinuses. It can either develop as a common sinus infection (rhinitis, a cold) or less commonly in conjunction with allergies. If sinusitis lasts longer than two months, it is referred to as being chronic. The maxillary sinus is often affected as well in acute or chronic infections. Because of the swelling of the mucosa in the paranasal sinuses, its secretions can no longer flow out properly and they become lodged in the paranasal sinuses. There they can become infected with pathogens (such as viruses).",
        "DescriptionShort": "Sinusitis occurs when the cavities of the nose become inflamed and swollen. The condition is usually caused by a virus and  improves often within a short period of time maximum up to three weeks. It is less commonly coming in combination with an allergy.",

        "Description": "Vitamin D is responsible for calcium absorption and thus bone formation. Vitamin D deficiency is common in countries with less sunshine, since natural vitamin D can only be formed when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Since the population don’t get enough sunlight during the year length and protect often from sun exposure with sun lotion during summer time, the bodies are not able to produce this necessary vitamin. It’s possible to get some vitamin D through dietary supplements, such as cod liver, salmon, chicken eggs, and beef liver, but the amount of vitamin that these sources provide is not sufficient.",
        "DescriptionShort": "Vitamin D deficiency is a regular condition. Vitamin D plays vital roles for numerous functions within the body including reducing inflammation, promoting cell and bone growth, keeping normal levels of phosphate and calcium, and promoting the absorption of calcium. For these reasons a lack of Vitamin D can commonly lead to osteomalacia in adults or rickets in children.",
        "MedicalCondition": "Numerous factors can lead to lack of vitamin D. A firm vegan regime for a long period can deprive the body from the sufficient amount of vitamin D since animals are the natural providers of this vitamin. A limited exposure to the light from sun can also lead to vitamin D deficiency since the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to its light. A limited exposure to the light from the sun can happen when a person puts on long dresses or covers themselves for religious motives, or have activities that keep them away from the sun. People with dark skin are also at risk of vitamin D deficiency since the ability of the skin to produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight is reduced by the pigment melanin. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused also by the inability of the kidney to convert this vitamin to its active type. This can happen in case of disease or ageing process. This deficiency can also be caused by the inability of the digestive tract to absorb adequately vitamin D. This can be the result of some medical issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic disease that affect the ability of the intestine to absorb the vitamin from the food eaten. Obesity can also cause vitamin D deficiency as fat cells extract the vitamin from the blood, fluctuating its discharge into the circulation. Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include muscle weakness and bone pain. However, many people have subtle symptoms. Yet, deficiency of vitamin D can expose the body to health risks such as cardiovascular disease, severe asthma, cancer, and cognitive impairment. A vitamin D deficiency in children can lead to rickets, a condition in which bone development is arrested. Adults can suffer from osteomalacia.",

It has been shown that muscle power increases based on that and that the bone loss (osteoporosis) can be positively influenced as well as the frequency of falls can be reduced. As the diseases related to a deficiency of vitamin D can be critical it is important for a potentially affected person to find a suitable therapy with help of a medical doctor in order to reach the necessary level of vitamin D."

Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.",

        "Description": "Hypoglycemia means a symptomatic low blood sugar level. The body needs glucose to have enough energy. After the meal, the gut absorbs glucose and delivers it into the blood. If one eats more sugar than the body needs at that time, the pancreas releases insulin, which makes muscles and liver store the excessive part. When the blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone (glucagon) tells the liver to release glucose.",

In diabetes patients factors like taking too much diabetes medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or excessive exercising are common causes that lead to a hypoglycemia. Besides, alcohol consumption, illness, insulin overproduction (due to a tumor), or other endocrine dysfunctions can lead to low blood sugar levels. Without enough glucose, the body cannot perform its normal function. Normally it is defined as hypoglycemia when the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dl. The common symptoms include blurry vision, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, pale skin, headache, hunger, shaking, sweating, and finally even loss of consciousness. A big problem is that patients will feel these symptoms very late or misconstrue them and therefore be unable to consume some sugar before the loss of consciousness occurs.",

Further treatments of hypoglycemia depend on its causes. For example, if the medications caused hypoglycemia, then the doctor will adjust the dose. If one has a certain tumor such as pancreas tumor, it will be treated by surgical removal. If one has diabetes, the doctor’s prescription should be followed and the blood sugar should be checked regularly. If none of the causes apply, the lifestyle may be the cause for the hypoglycemia. In case of hypoglycemia consulting a doctor for a proper treatment way is recommended."

More severe forms can be treated with medications or surgery.",
        "MedicalCondition": "The causes of aortic regurgitation include valvular dysfunctions and abnormalities of the ascending aorta. 1) Valvular dysfunction: congenital valvular disorders such as a bicuspid aortic valve cause more frequently valvular dysfunctions. But acquired causes like rheumatic fever, endocarditis, degenerative aortic valve diseases (aortic sclerosis), trauma and surgery are the most common causes of valvular dysfunctions and aortic regurgitation. 2) Aorta abnormalities: expansion of the aorta may also lead to an insufficient closure of the aortic valves and cause reverse blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. Therefore an aortic sclerosis, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a dissection of the aorta may also result in aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur either acute or chronic. Acute aortic regurgitation can manifest with the sudden appearance of significant symptoms such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and heart failure. Chronic aortic regurgitation normally happens gradually and can lead to an enlargement of the heart and end in a heart failure.
