If a patient says: "{{lastMessageContent}}". What are the probable symptoms?

You must choose from the following symptoms list in JSON format (please also consider the related body location):
{{symptiomsJson}}

Reply also with a JSON.
You don't have to choose a symptom, if the user didn't provide specific information about their symptoms, or there's no sutiable symptons in the above list, just reply with an empty array `[]`.
You can't create any new symptoms, or choose unrelated symptoms.
Example:
{
  selectedSymptoms: [],
  explain: "...", // string, explain why you choose these symptoms, or why you don't choose any symptoms.
  userProvidedSymptomsRelatedInfo: boolean, // true if the user provided any information about their symptoms, false otherwise.
}
